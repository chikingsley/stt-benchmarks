Introduction 


Colloquial French is intended for adult beginners who have little 
or no prior knowledge of French. It has been designed in such a 
way that it can be used in adult education classes or by learners 
who wish to study at home at their own pace and in their own 
time. 

Colloquial French covers the basic structures and the vocabu- 
lary of everyday situations which you are likely to encounter, 
whether on holiday or on business in France and in other French- 
speaking countries. Its emphasis is on spoken French and its 
primary aim is to develop your communication skills. 

The language is approached in a functional and communicative 
way so that you can easily use what you have learned to communi- 
cate in French effectively. We have kept the grammatical expla- 
nations as simple and user-friendly as possible to allow you to 
progress at a steady pace but at the same time build up a sound 
understanding of how the language works and so build up your 
confidence. 

Colloquial French comprises a book and an audio CD or audio- 
cassettes containing recordings of the dialogues together with oral 
activities. 


How is the course organised? 


There are eighteen units, normally laid out in the same way. At 
the beginning of the book, you will find a pronunciation guide and 
at the end, the key to the exercises, a reference grammar, a 
French-English glossary and two indexes. 


Introduction 


What is in a unit? 


Dialogues 


There are normally two per unit. Their main function is to intro- 
duce the key points of the unit, in context, and in a way that the 
French would use them. They are also essential for developing your 
listening and speaking skills. 

In Units 1-8, the French dialogues are immediately followed by 
their translation into English. From Unit 9 onwards, a glossary of 
new vocabulary is provided instead. 


Language points 


Under functional (e.g.: expressing preferences) or grammatical 
headings (e.g.: using y) are given clear and concise explanations of 
new structures, together with examples. Grammatical terms and 
explanations have been simplified and kept to a minimum so that 
you can understand the mechanisms underpinning structures and 
use them successfully and confidently. 


Exercises 


These follow the language points and provide you with lots of 
practice in the new structures you are learning. Some of the exer- 
cises are also recorded on the CD/cassettes. There is a key to the 
exercises at the end of the book. 


Other features 


In some units, and when useful, we have included some cultural 
points about France. We have also included some short texts 
covering topics in some units. These texts contain some of the 
language learned and are there to provide you with further exam- 
ples of the language, as well as to start developing your reading 
skills. 


Introduction 


The recordings and how to work 
with them 


The recordings contain the dialogues and a variety of exercises 
designed to improve your pronunciation, intonation and communi- 
cation skills. 

When you first listen to a dialogue, try not to look at the tran- 
scription of the dialogue or the translation. Focus your listening on 
the following questions. Who is talking? Where is the dialogue 
taking place? What is the purpose of the conversation? If you need 
to, listen to the recording again, until you can answer those three 
questions. Then listen again and focus on words you can recognise 
or understand. Write them down and try to make sensible guesses 
about what you don’t understand yet. Then check your guesses by 
listening and reading at the same time. Avoid looking at the trans- 
lation until you are happy you’ve tested yourself as much as you 
can. Approaching listening activities, and particularly the dialogues 
in this way, will initially take time. But as you progress through 
the course, it will become second nature and will take far less time. 
You will then acquire a growing confidence in your ability to under- 
stand native French speakers and will be more successful in 
communicating with them. 

You can further improve your listening and oral skills by 
listening repeatedly to the recordings, even and especially if they 
are related to units you have already studied. You can do this in 
your car or while you are doing something clse. The more you 
listen to the language, the easier it will become to understand what 
is being said. Because your ear will become more and more accus- 
tomed to hearing French, you will not only memorise the struc- 
tures and vocabulary more effectively, but you will also improve 
your pronunciation and intonation. You should also use the record- 
ings to practise your pronunciation and intonation by repcating 
what you hear. 


General learning tips 


Learning a language is not difficult but requires time, patience and 
dedication. It’s usually better for learners to work often (say three 
to four times a week) and for short periods of time (30-40 minutes) 
rather than plan to do two hours every weekend. So, don’t be too 


Introduction 


ambitious with the goals you set for yourself. A realistic timetable 
of when you can work on your language will avoid frustrations and 
disappointments. 

It’s often difficult to keep motivation going if you learn on your 
own. Try to find someone to work with. It’s generally more moti- 
vating to learn a language together with someone else. Remember 
that there are lots of activities in the course that easily lend them- 
selves to role-playing. Make the most of them if you are learning 
with someone else and above all enjoy yourself. 


Bon courage! 


Pronunciation guide 


The sounds 


These are often not too difficult to master, with a little practice. It 
might be useful to learn the phonetic transcription of the sounds 
of French, especially if you intend to go beyond this book. You 
can then find out how a word is pronounced by looking it up in a 
good bilingual or monolingual French dictionary. Each entry will 
have its phonetic transcription. Here, we have given both the 
phonetic transcription of most French sounds and, whenever there 
is one, a nearest English equivalent. 

In the following section square brackets denote a symbol from 


the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). 


Vowels 
IPA French examples Nearest English 
equivalents 

[a] taxi, ami, chat cat, tap 

[i] vie, dit, lycée sleep, tea (but shorter) 

[ul] vous, pour, nous you, fool (but shorter) 

[y] tu, rue, plus no equivalent 

[e] thé, aller, chez a cross between fit, pin 
and jelly, tepid 

[e] faire, mere, belle fair, mare 

[o] mot, beau, moto raw (but shorter) 

[>| port, homme, donne porridge, olive 


peur, leur, meuble

premier, ce, le 


fur, purr 
no equivalent 


perform, preparation 


Pronunciation guide 


Tips for pronouncing [y], [a] and [o] 


— for [y] and [9], your lips should be forward, making an O shape 
(rather like for a kiss!) 

— for [y], start with the sound [i] 

— for [¢], start with the sound [a] 

— for [o], your tongue should be more forward in your mouth than 
for [9], your lips more forward and your mouth less open. 


The four nasalised vowels 


There are no English equivalents for these. They originate from 
the basic vowels [a], [9], [¢] and [ce], which means that, in effect, 
the position of the tongue and the lips and the opening of the 
mouth are the same as for the basic vowels. They are called 
nasalised because the air used to pronounce them partly travels 
through the nasal cavities. Check whether you are saying them 
correctly, by feeling to see if there is a little vibration when you 
pinch lightly just below the bridge of your nose. 


[a] banc, vent, temps, amphithéatre 
[5] long, sombre 

[E] vin, américain, plein, faim 

[ce] lundi, parfum 


[ce] is only pronounced in the south of France. It becomes [&] as 
soon as you move northwards, above the Massif Central. 

When an, en, em, on, om, in, ain, ein, aim, un, um are followed 
by a vowel or another n or m, they are not pronounced as nasals: 


J’aime le chocolat 
Monaco 

Une Italienne 
Une année

[d] départ, aide, adorer deep, adapt 

[g] gare, alguc, gondole gorilla, garbage 
[f] téléphoner, fils, famille fire, phone 

[s] ici, ¢a, dessert, sel, nation salt, sell 

(S] cher, vache, acheter fish, mesh 

[v] vous, avec, verre very, vintage

[r] rue, programme, Paris no equivalent 
[m] mon, mére, montagne mother, merry 
[n] non, année, Nimes no, never 

[n] vigne, Agnés, agneau annual 


Tips on pronouncing the sound [r] 


It is pronounced at the back of the mouth, rather like when you 
are trying to clear your throat! Try it on its own first and then with 
a vowel sound before it: 


tard 
tort 
terre 
fort 


Once you think you are near enough, try to do it with a vowel 
after it: 


rue 
retard 
roti 
rapide 


Spelling and sounds 
In French, the way a word is spelled is often enough to know how 


it is pronounced. Here are the most basic rules that are useful to 
memorise. 


Pronunciation guide 


The letter ‘c’ 


is pronounced [k] in front of the letters a, o and u: 
cadeau, cou, cure 

— is pronounced [s] in front of the letters e, i and y: 
cela, cite, cygne 

— ¢ +h are normally pronounced [J]: 
chat, cher, chute 

— ¢ +h are sometimes pronounced [k]: 

psychose, charisme 


Note that ¢ is always pronounced [s] and used in front of the letters 
a,o and u: 


ca, les Acores 


The letter ‘g’ 


— is pronounced [g] in front of the letters a, o and u: 
gare, gorille, guerre 
— is pronounced [3] in front of the letters e and i: 


gérer, gite 


The letter ‘s’ 
— is normally pronounced [z] when it is placed in between two 
vowels: 
désert, isotherme, phase 
— is normally pronounced [s] in all other cases: 
statistique, social 


Note that the letters ‘ss’ are used in between two vowels to produce 
the sound [s]: 


dessert, associer 


Pronunciation guide 


The letter ‘e’ 


Is normally pronounced [e] in front of a double consonant: 


belle, terre, prennent 


Accents and sounds 


Accents in French can be disconcerting for a learner, but they are 
important, because, in a lot of cases, they will give you the key to 
how a word is pronounced and will also help to differentiate 
between words which are nearly identical but have different mean- 
ings. 


Compare: 


marche — walking, working 
marché market, walked 


The following accents can be found on the letters a, e, 1, 0 and u: 


accent aigu acute accent 
accent grave grave accent 
accent circonflexe circumflex accent 


e With the letters a, i, 0 and u, you can find the accent grave and 
circonflexe, which generally do not alter the sound of the vowel. 

e With the letter e, you can find all three accents; -é is always 
pronounced [e]; -€ is always pronounced [e]; -€ can be pro- 
nounced [e] or [e].

Dialogue 1 () (cp 1:1) 


‘a 


Dans le taxi 


In the taxi 


Anne Murdoch arrives in Belzain, a French town, and takes a taxi 
to her hotel. Try to understand what we learn about her. 


ANNE: Bonjour, monsieur. H6tel Les Lilas, s’il vous plait. 

CHAUFFEUR:  HO6tel Les Lilas? On y va, madame. Vous étes 
anglaise? 

ANNE: Non, je suis écossaise, mais habite en Angleterre. 

CHAUFFEUR: A Londres? 

ANNE: Non, je travaille a Londres, mais j’habite a 
Coventry. 


CHAUFFEUR: — Vous parlez bien frangais! 
ANNE: Merci. C’est gentil! 


Unit 1: First contacts 


CHAUFFEUR: — Voila, on est arrivé. Ca fait 8 euros, madame. 
ANNE: Voila. Merci beaucoup, monsieur. Au revoir. 
CHAUFFEUR: — Au revoir et bon séjour! 


ANNE: Hello. Hotel Les Lilas, please. 

Taxi-DRIVER: Hotel Les Lilas? OK. Are you English? 

ANNE: No, I’m Scottish but I live in England. 
TAXI-DRIVER: In London? 

ANNE: No, | work in London but I live in Coventry. 
TAXI-DRIVER: You speak good French! 

ANNE: Thank you. That’s very kind! 

TAXI-DRIVER: Here we are. That’s 8 euros. 

ANNE: Here you are. Thank you very much. Goodbye. 


TAXI-DRIVER: Goodbye and enjoy your stay! 


Language points 


Greetings and opening moves () (CD 1; 2) 


The French use monsieur and madame much more frequently than 
speakers of English use sir and madam. Note how Anne greets the 
taxi-driver and how he says goodbye to her. 


Bonjour, monsieur. Au revoir, madame. 


Bonsoir is used in the evening, both when you greet people and 
when you leave. 


Bonsoir, monsieur. Bonsoir, madame. 


Salut is more informal and is used between people who generally 
know each other well. It is also used both to greet people and when 
you leave. 


Salut Pierre! Salut Martine! 


Politeness is also greatly appreciated in France. The French will 
normally say bonjour, au revoir and merci when entering and 
leaving a shop, even if they just go in to have a look. Do not forget 
to say s’il vous plait when asking for something. 


Un café, s’il vous plait. 
Merci.

Unit 1: Premiers contacts 


Talking about nationalities ( ) (co 1:3) 

To ask about Anne’s nationality, the taxi-driver said: 
Vous étes anglaise? 

She answered: 


Non, je suis écossaise. 


To give your nationality To give your nationality 


in French, you say in French, you say 

if you are a man: if you are a woman: 

Je suis anglais. Je suis anglaise. (1 am English) 
Je suis francais. Je suis francaise. (1 am French) 
Je suis écossais. Je suis écossaise. (1 am Scottish) 
Je suis hollandais. Je suis hollandaise. (1 am Dutch) 


Note that the pronunciation changes as well as the spelling. Here 
are some more examples: 


Je suis américain. Je suis américaine. (American) 
Je suis italien. Je suis italienne. (Italian) 
Je suis allemand. Je suis allemande. (German) 


Sometimes, the spelling might change but the pronunciation will 
stay the same: 


Je suis espagnol. Je suis espagnole. (Spanish) 


Note that, generally, the mark of the feminine is an -e. 
But when the adjective of nationality already ends in -e in its 
masculine form, it remains unchanged in its feminine form: 


Je suis belge. Je suis belge. (Belgian) 
Je suis russe. Je suis russe. (Russian) 


Did you notice? 


Adjectives of nationality in French do not have a capital letter. 
Capital letters are used only: 


e for the names of countries, e.g. la France, l’Angleterre; 
e for the noun when it refers to the people of a country, e.g. un 
Italien (an Italian), une Anglaise (an Englishwoman). When it 


Unit 1: First contacts 13 


refers to a language, there is no capital letter, e.g. espagnol 
(Spanish), le russe (Russian). 


The verb étre (to be) 


Je suis italien/italienne. | am Italian 

Tu es espagnol/espagnole. You (informal) are Spanish. 
ll est francais. He is French. 

Elle est francaise. She is French. 

Nous sommes en vacances. We are on holiday. 

Vous @tes en vacances? Are you on holiday? 

Ils sont a Londres. They are in London. 


Elles sont a Paris. They are in Paris. 


Note that elles represents a group of women only whereas 
ils will include at least one man. 


Exercise 1 


Fill in the gaps with the correct form of étre. 


1 Vous ____ frangais? Non, je SUISSe. 

2 Ils______s angziais. 

3 Le Monde _____ un journal frangais. 

4 Nous _____ belges mais nous habitons a Paris. 
5 Tu______ espagnole? 

6 Elle ___ italienne. 


Exercise 2 


Answer the following questions about the nationality of the 
following people. 


Example: Winston Churchill est américain? 
Non, il est anglais. 


Madonna est anglaise? 
Tchaikovsky est belge? 

Juliette Binoche est italienne? 
Pedro Almodovar est russe? 

Et vous? Vous étes frangais(e)?

Unit 1: Premiers contacts 


Language points 


Asking questions 


The simplest way to ask a question in French is to use intonation. 
When asking a question, your voice must have a rising intonation 
at the end of the sentence to distinguish it from a statement. 


art 

Vous étes francais. (statement) 
ee 

Vous étes francais? (question) 


Did you notice? 
When the taxi-driver asked Anne if she was English, he said: 


Vous étes anglaise? 
Zz 


This is called a liaison. Liaisons are a feature of French pronunci- 
ation. There are some rules, but the easiest way is to try to imitate 
what you hear as much as you can. 


Giving more information about 
yourself 


Anne is Scottish, but what else do we know about her? 


Elle habite en Angleterre, a Coventry. 
She lives in England, in Coventry. 


Elle travaille a Londres. 
She works in London. 


Elle parle bien francais. 
She speaks good French. 


Verbs in French change their form according to the person (je, tu, 
il, elle, etc.) they are used with. This is called conjugation. We have 
provided you with more information on how verbs are conjugated 
in the reference grammar. 


Unit 1: First contacts 


Habiter, travailler and parler are -er verbs, so-called because 
their infinitive (the form under which you will find them in any 
dictionary) ends in -er. Most -er verbs are regular in the way that 
they change their form according to the person (je, tu, il, elle, etc.) 
they are used with. Since most French verbs are -er verbs, it is 
useful to try to memorise the model below. For regular -er verbs 
such as travailler, you simply need to take off the -er and add the 
endings as shown. 


The verb travailler (to work) 


Je travaill e Nous travaill 

Tu travaill es Vous travaill ez 

Il travaill e Ils travaill ent 

Elle travaill e Elles travaill ent 

Note that je will drop its e in front of a vowel or an h e.g. 


j‘habite. The forms travaille, travailles and travaillent are 
pronounced in the same way. 


Here are a few other verbs which work in exactly the same way: 


téléphoner to phone écouter to listen 
regarder to look arriver to arrive 
aimer to like/love 


You should practise conjugating them. 


Exercise 3 () (CD 1; 5) 


Answer the following questions about Anne Murdoch, making full 
sentences. 


1 Elle est anglaise? 3 Elle travaille a Coventry? 
2 Elle habite 4 Londres? 4 Elle parle frangais? 


Now answer these questions: 


5 Vous étes écossais(e)? 7 Vous travaillez 4 Londres? 
6 Vous habitez a Londres? 8 Vous parlez anglais? 


15 


16 


Unit 1: Premiers contacts 


Language points 


Did you notice? 


Anne travaille en Angleterre. 
Elle habite a Coventry. 


The French will usually use a in front of the name of a town and 
en in front of the name of a country. 


J’habite en France, a Courchevel, mais je travaille en Suisse. 
I live in France, in Courchevel, but I work in Switzerland. 


However, you will find that 4, au, and aux will sometimes be used 
in front of names of countries. More information will be given in 


Unit 5.

All nouns in French are either masculine or feminine. Few nouns 
in English have a gender (e.g. man/woman, brother/sister) and 
English speakers might find it difficult to believe that chaise (chair) 
in French is feminine but stylo (pen) is masculine. There is no hard- 
and-fast rule. So, you will need to memorise the gender of a noun 
together with its meaning. 

The gender of a noun will affect words directly connected with 
it (such as articles un/une, lefla) and their form will usually change 
accordingly. Un/une is usually the equivalent of a/an and le/la is 
usually the equivalent of the. 


Nous avons wn sauna. Nous avons une piscine. 
Le sauna est au sous-sol. La piscine est au sous-sol.

Can you tell me the way to the Tourist Information Office, 
please? 


Pour aller a \a poste, s’il vous plait? 
Pour aller a Photel du Parc, s’il vous plait? 


When the noun following pour aller a is masculine and starts with 
a consonant, a and le combine to give au: 


Pour aller au théatre, s’il vous plait? 


Or, you can use chercher in the following way, particularly when 
you stop people in the street: 


Excusez-moi, je cherche une banque. 
Excuse me, I am looking for a bank. 


Excusez-moi, je cherche la gare. 
Excuse me, I am looking for the station.

Both un cours and une allée or des allées tend to be broader 
avenues. La place (the town square), when you hear it in the 
context of a small town, will refer to the main town square and 
will often, if not always, have un monument aux morts, a 
monument to commemorate the people who died during the 
First and Second World Wars. La Libération refers to the 
liberation in the Second World War and le 11 novembre is 
the date of the armistice at the end of the First World War.

Saying what you like and don’t like ( ) 
(CD 1; 19) 


To enquire about what someone likes, you can use the following 
questions: 


Vous aimez le poisson? 
Do you like fish? 


Qu’est-ce que vous aimez? 
What do you like? 


To answer the previous questions, you can use the following verbs: 
aimer, adorer, détester. They all follow the pattern of travailler. 
Aimer is often used in combination with beaucoup, bien to express 
how much you like something. Ne... pas beaucoup, ne ... pas 
tellement and ne... pas du tout are also used very frequently with 
this verb. 


¥¥¥ = J'adore la mousse au chocolat. 
I love chocolate mousse. 


vv J’aime beaucoup \es légumes. 
I like vegetables a lot. 


v Jaime bien les fruits. 
I quite like fruit. 


a Je n’aime pas beaucoupltellement les escargots. 
I am not too keen on snails. 


Unit 3: Eating and drinking 


aa Je n’aime pas du tout \e poulet. 
I don’t like chicken at all. 


444 Je déteste les épinards. 
I hate spinach. 


Remember that you will need le, la, P or les in front of the noun. 


Il est végétarien parce qu’il n’aime pas du tout Ja viande. 
He is a vegetarian because he does not like meat at all. 


Exercise 2 


Read Dialogue | again and say if the following statements are true 
or false (vrai ou faux). Whenever they are not true, correct them 
by giving the right statement. 


Example: Francois n’aime pas les artichauts et les asperges. 
C’est faux. Francois adore les artichauts et les 
asperges.

3 Juliette aime beaucoup le poisson. 

4 Juliette n’aime pas du tout les desserts. 


Exercise 3 () (CD 1; 20)

J’aime bien les moules mais je préféere les huitres.

Anne hesitates between the mussels and the assiette printani¢re. 
She has not made up her mind yet as to what dish she would prefer. 


Anne hésite entre les moules et l’assiette printaniere. 


Exercise 4 () (CD 1; 21) 


Qu’est-ce que vous préférez? For each two items of food below, 
using the verbs you have learned, say that you like one but prefer 
the other. 


1 snails, oysters 3. chicken, fish 
2 ice cream, apple pie 4 steak tartare, tuna 


Language points 


Did you notice? 
Anne did not know what a carpaccio de saumon was. So she asked 
Juliette: 


Qu’est-ce que c’est, un carpaccio de saumon? 
(literally) What is it, a carpaccio of salmon? 


C’est des tranches fines de saumon cru. 
(literally) It’s thin slices of raw salmon. 


Because tranches is plural, strictly speaking, Juliette should have 
said: 


Ce sont des tranches fines de saumon cru. 


But increasingly, and especially in the spoken language, the French 
will use c’est even if the noun that follows is in the plural. 


Exercise 5 
Using qu’est-ce que c’est, ask what the following are: 


1 une assiette de crudités 

2 un carpaccio de boeuf 

3 le Ricard® 

4 une assiette de charcuterie

(b) des tranches fines de boeuf cru 

(c) des tranches de charcuterie: saucisson, jambon, paté... 
(d) une sélection de légumes crus: tomates, carottes, céleri... 


And then answer the questions:

WAITER: Have you chosen? What would you like? 

ANNE: I would like a Perrier® menthe, please. 

JULIETTE; Pll have a Diet Coke®. 

WAITER: With ice? 

ANNE & JULIETTE: Yes. 

WAITER: What about you, sir? What are you having? 

FRANCOIS: A (draught) beer please. Do you have Kronen- 
bourg®? 

WAITER: Yes, of course. A half? 

FRANCOIS: Yes, please. 

WAITER: So, a half of lager, a Perrier® menthe and a Diet

Language points 


Ordering food and drinks 
In a restaurant or a café, you are likely to hear the waiter say to 
you: 


Vous avez choisi? 
(literally) Have you chosen? 


Unit 3: Eating and drinking 


Qu’est-ce que vous prenez? 
What are you having? 


Qu’est-ce que je vous sers? 
(literally) What am I serving you? 


You can reply in the following ways: 


Je voudrais une biére. 
I would like a beer. 


Je prends un café. 
Pll have a coffee. 


Un thé, s’il vous plait. 
A tea, please. 


The verb prendre (to take) 


Je prends un Coca® Nous prenons une bouteille 
de vin 


Tu prends une glace Vous prenez un chocolat 


ll prend un café Ils prennent un taxi 


Elle prend un dessert Elles prennent le bus

Unit 3: Manger et boire 


Here are a few popular drinks (des boissons) which the French like 
to have when they go to a café: 


une cau minérale gazeuse —sune eau minérale non gazeuse 
sparkling mineral water still mineral water 


Note that the French will normally ask for a specific brand. 


Vocabulary 

une menthe a l’eau a sort of mint-flavoured cordial (sirop) with a 
distinctive green colour, diluted with water 

un demi a half of lager 

un demi-panaché a half of lager-shandy 

un jus d’orange orange juice 

un jus de pamplemousse = grapefruit juice 

un jus de tomate tomato juice 

un café a coffee 

un café creme coffee with hot milk 

un thé au lait tea with milk 

un thé au citron tea with a slice of lemon 

un kir a glass of dry white wine with a dash of 


blackcurrant syrup 


Cultural point 


There are other drinks of course. Bear in mind that most French 
people do not go to a café to drink alcohol. They will enjoy 
un apéritif in the early evening and will move on fairly rapidly to 
have a meal. Le vin (wine) is not normally drunk outside meals or 
apéritifs. And if, like many French, you go to a café to enjoy un 
café, remember that you will be served an espresso! 


Exercise 6 () (CD 1; 23) 


Fill in the blanks with the correct forms of prendre in the following 
dialogue. 


SERVEUR: Messieurs-dames, qu’est-ce que vous (1) ___s? 
SYLVIE: Je (2) un Orangina® s’il vous plait. 
PIERRE: Tu ne (3) pas un demi? 

SYLVIE: Non, je n’aime pas tellement la biere. 

PIERRE: Et toi, Mary, qu’est-ce que tu (4)__——sé“? 
MARY: Qu’est-ce quwils (5) ____—s a la table a cété? 


SERVEUR: Une menthe a l’eau, madame. 


Unit 3: Eating and drinking 


Here is the rest of the dialogue. Mary’s part has been cut out: work 
out what she says. 


MARY: (6) 

PIERRE: C’est un sirop de menthe avec de I’eau. 
MARY: (¢) ne 

PIERRE: Moi aussi! 

SERVEUR: Alors, deux menthes a l’eau et un Orangina®. 


Language points 


Did you notice? 
Moi, je prends un Coca® light. 
I am having a Diet Coke®. 


Et toi Mary, qu’est-ce que tu prends? 
What about you Mary? What are you having? 


Pour moi, une biére pression, s’il vous plait. 
A (draught) beer for me, please. 


Alongside the forms of the pronouns je, tu, il, elle, etc., the French 
language also has the strong forms moi, toi, lui, elle as follows. 


je moi nous nous 
tu toi vous vous 
il lui ils eux 

elle elle elles elles 


You will need to use these strong forms: 


e when you want to put some emphasis on the person (je, tu, il, 
elle, etc.): 


Moi, je prends une biére; 
e after c’est: 


C’est Pierre? Oui, c’est lui. 
Is it Pierre? Yes it’s him. 


e after words such as pour, avec and et: 


Pour moi, un Coca®. Il est avec moi. 
Et toi? He is with me.

Unit 3: Manger et boire 


Language points 


Using tu and vous 


You may have noticed in Dialogue 2 how Francois addressed 
Juliette, using tu: 


Tu ne prends pas une petite patisserie, Juliette? 


Vous can be used to address one person or more than one person 
whereas tu can only be used to address one person. 

Tu is normally only used for members of a family, friends and 
young children. Vous is used whenever you do not know the person 
you are talking to very well or at all. As the French tend to be 
more formal than the British, they will use vous at work, especially 
with colleagues of a higher rank. If in doubt about what you should 
use when talking to a French-speaking person, use vous and wait 
until you are invited to use tu. The French normally use two verbs 
— vouvoyer (to use vous) and tutoyer (to use tu) — to indicate this. 


Il me tutoie. Nous le vouvoyons. 
He uses fu with me. We use vous with him. 


Exercise 7 


Put the words in the right speech bubbles. 


Oul, et toi? Vous travaillez a Londres? 
Oui, et vous? Tu prends un café? 


Unit 3: Eating and drinking 47 


Language points 


Did you notice? 


une soupe de poisson une glace @ la fraise 

un jus d’orange une truite aux amandes 
(aux = a + les) 

une assiette de crudités une tarte aux pommes 
(aux = a + les) 


The French will normally link two nouns together with words such 
as a or de. Whereas de will indicate what a dish or drink is made 
of, a will refer to a flavour or particular way in which a dish or 
drink is prepared. This is a subtle difference and even the I'rench 
are not too sure which one they should use sometimes! So, don’t 
worry. You will learn more about a and de in Unit 4. 


Exercise 8 


Fill in the blanks with a, aux, de, or d’: 


1 Une menthe __ leau 

2 Une glace ___ la vanille 

3 Une tarte ___ abricots 

4 Unjus __ ananas (pineapple juice) 
5 Uncivet __ lapin (rabbit stew)

Vous étes tres différents alors? 

Ca, oui! Il travaille beaucoup. II n’a pas vraiment de 
temps pour les loisirs. Quelquefois, nous faisons du 
tennis ou du vélo ensemble, mais c’est rare. Et vous? 
Qu’est-ce que vous faites de votre temps libre? 

Moi aussi, comme votre mari, je déteste faire de 
lexercice. Je préfere lire ou aller au concert. J’adore 
la musique, surtout le jazz. Mais pour rester en forme, 
je vais quand méme a la piscine une ou deux fois par 
semaine avec une amie. 


You are retired. Don’t you get bored? 

Oh no! I'm very sporty. I play golf. And I like walking 
and cycling. 

And is your husband fond of sport, too? 

Not at all. He doesn’t like sport very much, except on 
TV! Especially rugby and football matches! But still, 
he ts active. He goes fishing on Sundays and he plays 
chess in a small club. 

You are very different, then? 

You can say that again! He works a lot. He doesn’t 
really have much time for leisure activities. Sometimes, 
we play tennis or cycle together, but rarely. What about 
you? What do you do with your free time? 

Like your husband, I hate exercise, too. I prefer 
reading or going to a concert. I love music, espectally 
jazz. But, to keep fit, I do go swimming once or twice 
a week with a friend. 


Language points 


Talking about leisure 


To start a conversation on this topic, you could begin with: 


Qu’est-ce que vous faites de votre temps libre? 
How do you spend your free time? 


Unit 4: Meeting people 


To talk about things you do, you can use two verbs: aller and faire. 


Je vais au cinéma. Elle va a l’école. 

I go to the cinema. She goes to school. 
Je fais du tennis. Il fait de ’exercice. 
I play tennis. He exercises. 


The verbs aller (to go) and faire 
(to do or to make) 


Je vais a la piscine. Je fais du tennis. 

Tu vas au cinéma? Tu fais du sport? 

Il wa au match de football. Il fait de la moto. 

Elle va au restaurant. Elle fait du sport. 

Nous allons au cinéma. Nous faisons du football. 
Vous allez au theatre? Vous faites du yoga? 


lls vont aux toilettes. Ils font de I|’équitation. 
(horse riding) 

Elles vont a |’hotel. Elles font de I’escalade. 
(climbing) 


Did you notice that aller does not follow the pattern of the 
-er verbs (aimer, parler, jouer) we encountered in the 
previous chapters? 


Exercise 6 


Aller or faire? 


1 Pierre sd dee: P’exerrcice réguliérement. 
2 Nous ____ souvent au cinéma. 

3 Vous ____ au théatre, ce soir?

3 In the dialogue between Chantal and Anne, can you spot the 
verb used twice that uses the same construction as aller a? 


Unit 4: Meeting people 


Language points 


Using another verb in the infinitive to 

talk about things you like to do 

In previous lessons, you have used aimer, adorer, détester in this 
way: 


J’aime le poisson. 
Vous détestez le sport? 
Il adore le jambon de Parme. 


But you can also use these verbs with another verb in the infinitive: 


J’aime faire du sport. 
Vous détestez manger au restaurant? 
Il adore jouer au bridge. 


Read the dialogue again. Can you find examples to add to the list? 
Exercise 8 () (CD 1; 32)

My holidays are nearly finished, unfortunately, 
although I intend to rent a car for the weekend. But 
in the autumn I might go to Italy with a friend. She 
always takes a holiday in September. And from there, 
we are probably going to take the boat to Sicily. I don’t

Language points 


Did you notice? 
When Chantal told Anne what she and her husband were going to 
do, she used on: 


On va visiter les monuments romains. 
We are going to visit the Roman monuments. 


Though on can have other uses which you will no doubt discover 
later, it is often used in French to replace nous in informal speech. 


Unit 5: Holiday plans 


You will hear the French use it a lot. When you use it, remember 
that it works like il/elle: 


Il fait du tennis. 


Elle fait du tennis. On fait du tennis. 


Il va cinéma? ae 
5 Fi On va au cinéma? 
Elle va au cinéma? 


Exercise 4 


Answer the following questions, using on.

Language points 


Using connaitre and savoir 


Most of the time, both verbs are translated by to know in English. 
The difference between savoir and connafitre is not always easy to 
grasp, even for French people! We will limit ourselves to some 
clear-cut uses, here. 

You can use connaitre when you talk about a person, place, 
subject or domain of which you have knowledge, or with which 
you are acquainted or familiar: 


Vous connaissez la Gréce? 
Elle connait Anne Murdoch. 
Je connais bien la littérature francaise. 


Very often connaitre is followed by a noun. 

You can use savoir to talk about something you have practical 
knowledege of or simply whenever you want to translate you know, 
or / know on their own: 


66 


Je sais nager. 
I can swim. 


Unit 5: Projets de vacances 


— Il habite a Londres. 
- Je sais. 


Very often savoir is not followed by a noun.

Giving dates 


As with months of the year, the days of the week do not have a 
capital letter in French. Dates are expressed using cardinal numbers 
(two, twenty-five, and so on) and not, as in English, ordinal 
numbers (second, twenty-fifth, and so on), the only exception being 
the first of the month: le premier. When giving a precise date, the 
French normally use the article le in front of it.

the Friday or Monday off to make a bridge between the two 
days they officially are not at work. Frequently, businesses will 
close to allow their employees to faire le pont. If a bank

Saying what you need 


To say what you need in French you can use two forms. 
Il faut from the verb falloir can only be conjugated with il. Il 
does not stand for someone or something; it is only there to act as 


Unit 6: Shopping 


75 


a subject of the verb. Only the context or the use of me, te, nous, 
and so on, placed between il and faut, will enable you to know 


who is being talked about. 


You can use il (me/te/nous and so on) faut with a noun or 


another verb in the infinitive. 


Il faut du pain. 


One/you/we need(s) bread. 


Il faut travailler beaucoup. 
One/you/we need(s) to work a lot. 


Il me faut du thé. 
I need some tea. 


Il nous faut de la confiture. 


We need jam. 


Il te faut prendre des vacances. 


You need to take holidays. 


Alternatively, you can use avoir besoin de: 


J’ai besoin de \ait. 
I need milk. 


Nous avons besoin de miel et de biscuits. 
We need honey and biscuits.

Where is/where can I find the mustard, please? 


Excusez-moi, je cherche le rayon céréales, 
Excuse me, I’m looking for the cereals section?

Hypermarchés and supermarchés are normally found on the out- 
skirts of towns and cities in France. They are usually well provided 
with fresh produce and offer excellent value for money. Though 
you will usually find most of the things you can find in Britain, 


Unit 6: Shopping 


some sections (rayons) will offer a much wider choice of products. 
This is especially the case for le rayon des conserves and, if you 
are in a French supermarket, do not forget to visit the section on 
produits régionaux. In order to prevent theft and avoid trolleys 
being abandoned after use, you will need a one euro coin to collect 
a trolley (un caddy) from a designated area. You will be able to 
get your coin back only if you take your trolley to a designated 
area. AS most French supermarkets will have a petrol station, it is 
worth checking the price of petrol since it often tends to be lower 
than at the roadside stations.

a kilo of apples 


un litre de \ait 
a litre of milk 


500 grammes de cerises 
500 grammes of cherries 


un demi-litre de vin 
half a litre of wine 


The French use the metric system: | kilogram is roughly the equiv- 
alent of 2.2 Ibs and a litre is just under two pints. When shopping, 
the French will often use une livre to express 500 grammes. 


une livre de haricots verts 
500 grammes/half a kilo of green beans 


You will also find these useful: 


une tranche de pain 
un morceau de fromage 


a slice of bread 
a piece of cheese

Dans mon frigo, j’ai de la biére et du Coca® mais je n’ai pas 
d’eau minérale. 

In my fridge, I have beer and Coke but I don’t have any 
mineral water. 


So, when talking about quantities, all the articles un, une, des and

Paying for what you buy () (CD 1; 47) 


The French adopted the euro in January 2002. All prices are now 
displayed in euros, but you might still hear people speaking in 
francs or converting back to francs whenever they are not sure of 
the value of something. On price labels, decimals will appear after 
a coma, for example: 43,50 euros. 


82 Unit 6: Faire ses courses 


un billet de 5 euros a 5 euro note 
un billet de 20 euros a 20 euro note 
une piéce de 2 euros a 2 euro coin 
une piece de 50 centimes a 50 cent coin 


To ask for the price of something, you can say: 


Ca fait combien? Je vous dois combien? 
How much is it? How much do I owe you? 
C’est combien? Ca couite combien? 

How much is it? How much does it cost? 


You will hear people answer you in these ways: 


45 euros, monsieur. Ca fait 67 euros 50. 
It’s 67 euros 50. 


Ca coiite 23 euros. C’est 5 euros. 
It costs 23 euros. It’s 5 euros. 


Other useful expressions include: 


Vous avez la monnaie? 
Do you have the right change? 


Non je n’ai pas la monnaie. 
No, I do not have the right change. 


Vous avez de la monnaie? 
Do you have any small change? 


Non, je n’ai pas de monnaie. 
No, I don’t have any change. 


Vous payez en liquide? Are you paying cash? 
par carte de crédit? by credit card 
par cheque? by cheque 


Vous prenez les cartes de crédit? 
Do you take credit cards?

at Paris Orly at 12.10. The return flight from Orly ts 
at 16.40, arriving in Grenoble at 18.00. The price of 
the return ticket ts 260 euros. 

Wow! That’s not cheap! What about trains? 

You can take a direct TGV to Paris at 10.34, arriving 
in Paris at 13.35 for 77.70 euros. Wait, there’s some- 
thing even cheaper. You can take a train at 10.10 and 
be in Paris at 13.55 for 66.30 euros. But you have to 
change in Lyon.

Saying what you can do 


To say what you can do or cannot do, you can use pouvoir in the 
present tense. 

In all cases, pouvoir will be followed by another verb in the infini- 
tive, unless that verb is implied. 


Tu peux venir dimanche? 
Can you come on Sunday? 


Je peux (venir), oui. 
I can (come), yes. 


When you want to use the verb in the negative form, ne... pas 
will be placed on either side of pouvoir. 


Il ne peut pas partir vendredi. 
He cannot leave on Friday 


The verb pouvoir 


Je peux louer une voiture. 

Tu peux rentrer samedi? 

Il/elle/on peut arriver ce soir. 
Nous pouvons réserver une table. 
Vous pouvez aller au cinéma. 


lls/elles peuvent partir en train. 


Be careful! 


In English, we use can to mean to know how to do something. In 
these cases, the French will use savoir: 


Unit 7: Planning a business trip 87 


Vous savez nager? Il sait monter a cheval. 


Can you swim? He can ride. 


Elles savent bien cuisiner. Je ne sais pas conduire. 
They can cook well. I can’t drive.

Now, fill in the gaps with a correct form of pouvoir and savoir. 


Vous ____ arriver vers 8 heures? 

Je ne pas piloter un avion. 

Elle _————s renter dimanche. 

Tu _ louer une voiture pour le week-end.

Language points 


Did you notice? 


In 


previous units, you came across je voudrais to request some- 


thing in a polite way. 


Je voudrais un café, s’il vous plait. 


Here, in the dialogue, the travel agent uses another form of the 
same verb, vouloir, to ask what Anne wants to do. It is a form of 
vouloir in the present tense. 


Vous voulez prendre le train? 
Do you want to travel by train? 


88 Unit 7: Planifier un voyage d'affaires 


Vouloir in the present tense follows the same pattern as pouvoir: 


Je veux partir tot. 
I want to leave early. 


Nous ne voulons pas manger ici. 
We don’t want to cat here. 


Elles veulent un thé au citron. 
They want a lemon tea. 


Did you notice that vouloir can be followed by a noun or another 
verb in the infinitive? 


Saying what you have to do 


To say what you have to do or must do, you can use devoir or il 
faut (which you met in Unit 6) in the present tense. Like pouvoir, 
devoir is always followed by another verb in the infinitive. 


Sur le TGV, il faut réserver. 
On the TGV, one/you must/have to reserve a seat. 


Je dois partir a 8 heures. 
I must/have to leave at 8. 


Nous devons prendre un train. 
We must/have to take a train. 


Il ne doit pas réserver une place. 
He doesn’t have to book a seat. 


The verb devoir (must) 


Je dois partir. 

Tu dois rentrer. 

Il/elle/on doit réserver. 

Nous devons louer une voiture. 
Vous devez rester a Paris. 


Ils/elles doivent partir. 


Unit 7: Planning a business trip 89 


Exercise 2 () (CD 1; 50) 


You have been invited to do a number of things. Follow the model 
and make excuses, using devoir. 


Example: Vous voulez jouer au golf demain? 
Je ne peux pas. Je dois aller a Paris. 


1 Vous voulez manger avec moi? 


Je ne peux pas. —_ 
(say you have to go shopping) 


2 Vous voulez aller au cinéma, ce soir? 


Je ne peux pas. __ ee a

3 Vous voulez prendre l’apéritif? 


(say you can’t: you have to leave) 


Language points 


Telling the time with the 24-hour clock 


The 24-hour clock is used more and more in French, especially 
when giving times of trains, flights, buses or programmes. 


Le premier train part a 15 h 10. 
The first train leaves at 15.30. 


Il arrive a 20 h 56. 
It arrives at 20.56. 


Le film commence a 20 fh 35. 
The film starts at 20.35. 


The letter h stands for heure(s) (hours), and when you say the 
following times out loud, you should pronounce it. Hence you 
should say for: 


18 h 15 dix-huit heures quinze 


9h 45 neuf heures quarante-cing

Comparing things 


Regardless of the adjectives you use in French, you use plus 
(meaning ‘more’), moins (meaning ‘less’) and aussi (meaning ‘as’) 
to make comparisons. So, it is actually a lot simpler in French than 


in English. 


Pour le retour, je suis plus flexible. 
For the return, I am more flexible. 


Attendez, il y a encore moins cher. 
Wait, there’s even cheaper. 


C’est moins cher mais moins pratique. 
It’s cheaper but less convenient. 


Unit 7: Planning a business trip 


Tu veux vraiment prendre l’avion? En fait, le train est 
aussi rapide. 
Do you really want to fly? In fact, the train is as fast. 


You can also use que (here meaning ‘than’ or ‘as’) when you want 
to make it absolutely clear what you are comparing: 


Le train est aussi rapide que Vavion. Il est moins cher 
(que V’avion). 

Travelling by train is as fast as flying. It’s cheaper 
(than going by plane). 


Exercise 4 
Read the dialogue again and then correct these false statements. 


1 L’avion est moins cher que le train. 

2 Le train de 10 h 34 est aussi rapide que le train de 10 h 10. 

3 Le train de 10 h 34 est moins cher. 

4 Pour Anne, le train de 10 h 10 est plus pratique mais il est plus

Language points 


Describing people and things 


You can describe people or things with adjectives. In French, the 
adjective will agree in gender (masculine or feminine) and number 
(singular or plural) with the noun it is used with. Usually this means 
that, unless it already ends with an -e in its masculine form, the 
adjective will end with an -e if it is used with a feminine noun. 
And normally, unless it already ends with an -s or an -x in its 


Unit 7: Planning a business trip 


singular form, it will end with an -s when it is used with a noun in 
the plural. 


C’est un livre intéressant. 
It’s an interesting book. 


C’est une exposition intéressante. 
It’s an interesting exhibition. 


Elle achete des livres intéressants. 
She buys interesting books. 


Elle va a des expositions intéressantes. 
She goes to interesting exhibitions. 


There are other patterns. Here are a few to start you with: 


Masculine = Feminine 

bon, italien ... ne bonne, italienne 
nature/, actue/ (current) le naturelle, actuelle 
neuf (new), attentif... ve neuve, attentive 
délicieux, sérieux ... euse délicieuse, sérieuse 
premier, étranger (foreign)... ere premiere, étrangére 


All adjectives whose masculine form ends in -eau, will take an -x 
in the masculine plural. 


Il y a un nouveau film au cinéma. 
There’s a new film at the cinema. 


Elle aime bien ses nouveaux amis. 
She likes her new friends. 


There are also a few exceptions: 


Singular Plural 

Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminine 

beau belle beaux belles (beautiful) 
vieux/vieil _ vieille vieux Vieilles (old) 

long longue longs longues (long) 

faux fausse faux fausses (wrong/insincere ) 


frais fraiche frais fraiches (fresh) 


94 


Unit 7: Planifier un voyage d'affaires 


The position of adjectives 


The normal position for adjectives in French is after the noun. 
Il y a un film francais a la télévision, ce soir. 
Il achéte toujours des voitures étrangéres. 
However, the adjectives beau, bon, grand, petit, jeune (young), joli, 


vieux, long, dernier (last), gros (big), nouveau are generally placed 
before the noun. 


C’est une bonne idée! 
It’s a good idea. 


C’est un bon petit restaurant. 


Exercise 5 


In the sentences below, choose the form of the adjectives given in 
brackets which fits the gap. 


1 Ils ont une voiture __ 
(nouveau, anglaise, grande) 


2 C’est un film. 


(bon, nouvelle, francais) 
3 Jai un probleme.

Asking questions with est-ce que 


In the first unit, you learned one way of asking questions in French. 
You can also use est-ce que to ask a question in French. Both of 
these ways are used in standard French. 


Unit 7: Planning a business trip 


Tu aimes le poisson? 
or Est-ce que tu aimes le poisson? 
Do you like fish? 


Vous étes anglaise? 
or Est-ce que vous étes anglaise? 
Are you English? 
With quand (when), a quelle heure (what time), ot (where), 


combien (how much), qui (who) and quoi or que (what), this is 
how it works: 


Tu rentres quand? Quand est-ce que tu 
rentres?

Language points 


Talking about the past with the passe 
composé (perfect tense) 


How to form the passé composé 


In most cases, the passé composé (perfect tense) is formed by 
combining the present tense of avoir and a form of the main verb 
known as its past participle: 


Jai pris un taxi. 
J'ai oublié ma valise. 
Nous avons mangé au restaurant. 


Although, in this unit, we will concentrate only on verbs following 
this pattern, reflexive verbs and a small number of other verbs use 
étre instead of avoir when used in the passé composé. A full list 
of these will be given in the next unit. Did you spot the two exam- 
ples used by Anne and Malika? 


Ton voyage s’est bien passé? 
Je suis arrivée 4 Paris avec une heure de retard. 
So, to form the passé composé, you will need to know: 


e whether to use avoir or étre; 
e the past participle form of the verb you want to use. 


Unit 8: What a journey! 


All -er verbs have their past participle end in -é: 


manger mangé 
aller allé 
aimer aimé 


Most -ir verbs have their past participle end in -i. 


finir fini 
partir parti 
servir servi 


Though -u is also a frequent ending, as always with French there 
are quite a few exceptions! Here is a list of most useful verbs you 
will need to memorise: 


venir to come venu 
vendre to sell vendu 
prendre to take pris 
faire to do/make fait 
avoir to have eu 
étre to be été 
pouvoir to be able to pu 
devoir to have to du 
vouloir to want voulu 
dire to say dit 
entendre to hear entendu 
voir to see vu 
mettre to put mis 


When to use the passé compose 


Though the passé composé can generally be translated into English 
by the two forms below, depending on the context, those two forms 
in English will not necessarily be translated by the passé composé. 
So, relying on the English to choose when to use the passé composé 
might prove a little treacherous: 


J’ai téléphoné a Marie. 
I rang Marie. 
or Ihave rung Marie. 


Try to use the passé composé only when you recount key events 
that happened in the past. When you talk about past events or 


99 


100 


Unit 8: Quel voyage! 


states, what you say generally includes key events and secondary 
information, usually of a descriptive nature, which are there to flesh 
out a story. In the story below, all key events have been under- 
lined. In French, only the verbs in italics would be in the passé 
composé. 


I rang Marie yesterday. She was very tired and was watching a 


film on TV. I invited her out to see a band in a pub. A very well- 
known guitar player was performing. You know, when she was 


young, she played the guitar really well! After some persuasion, 
I finally managed to convince her to come out with me. 


Did you notice that ‘played’ would not be translated by a passé 
composé? 


Exercise 1 


Fill in the gaps putting the verbs in brackets in the passé compose. 


1 J?__- Ss (manger) au restaurant. 

2 Il (faire) des courses. 

3 Nous (jouer) au tennis.

5 Ils _ (acheter) un sofa. 

6 Tu (visiter) le musée Grévin?

Nous ne sommes pas artrivés a ’heure. 


We didn’t arrive/haven’t arrived on time.

Language points 


Did you notice? 


Mes parents sont sur cette photo. 
My parents are in this/that picture. 


When you need to refer to someone or something that is present 
in a situation or that you have already talked about, you can use 
ce, cette, ces. They are called the demonstrative adjectives. As with 
the possessive adjectives, the demonstratives change their form 
according to the number and gender of the nouns they are used 
with. 


Masculine Feminine 
Singular ce train cette valise 
Plural ces avions ces photos 


Note also that ce will become cet and will be pronounced like cette 
in front of a masculine noun in the singular starting with a vowel 
or an h: 


J’ai pris cet avion. 
I took this/that plane. 


In English, the demonstratives have two forms in the singular, ‘this’ 
and ‘that’, and two forms in the plural, ‘these’ and ‘those’. The 
French do not normally make this distinction. When it is essential 
to contrast ‘this’ and ‘that’, they will add -ci or more likely -la and 
point to the thing/person they are talking about. 


Vous voulez cette table-la? 
Do you want that table? 


Unit 8: What a journey! 109 


Exercise 8 


Fill in the blanks with ce, cet, cette, ces. If you are unsure of the 
gender of the nouns, check in your dictionary.

Language points 


Using the passé compose with verbs 
taking étre 


With the following small group of verbs, you form the passé 
composé by combining the present tense of @tre with the past 
participle of the verb that you want to use. 


Try memorising them in pairs of opposites. They are: 


arriver, partir to arrive, to leave 

aller, venir to go, to come 

entrer, sortir to come in, to go out 
rester, passer to stay, to pass by/call in 
retourner to go again/return 
monter, descendre to go up, to go down 
naitre, mourir to be born, to die 
tomber to fall 


devenir to become 


and compounds such as rentrer, revenir, and so on.

with the subject in the same way as adjectives do? 


Exercise 1 


Look at the sentences below and say whether je, tu and vous repre- 


sent a man or a woman.

Language points 


Reflexive verbs 


In French, a large number of verbs are reflexive. These verbs are 
made of a verb and a pronoun se which changes its form according 
to the subject of the verb. In our postcards we had seven reflexive 
verbs: s’amuser (to have fun), se reposer (to rest), se lever (to get 
up), se promener (to have/to go for a walk/a drive), se régaler (to 
enjoy/take a lot of pleasure), se souvenir de (to remember/recall), 
se marier (to get married). 

Four of these verbs were used in the present tense. Can you 
spot them? 


Ils s’amusent bien. 

Nous nous reposons, 

On se léve tous les jours a 10h. 
Tu fe souviens de Marina? 


The verb se relaxer (to relax) 


Je me relaxe Nous nous relaxons 
Tu te relaxes Vous vous relaxez 
Il/elle/on se relaxe lls/elles se relaxent 


Note that me, te and se will drop the e if the verb starts 
with a vowel or an ‘h’. 


115 


116 


Unit 9: On s‘amuse bien 


As se and its various forms are part of a reflexive verb, ne... pas 
will be placed on each side of the block formed by se and the verb 
in the present tense. 


Elle ne se repose pas beaucoup. 
Nous ne nous levons pas tard. 


Exercise 4 


Put the verbs in brackets into the present tense. 


1 Nous (se lever) a 8 heures. 

2 Il (s’amuser) bien. 

3 Vous _ (se souvenir de) Pierre? 

4 Je __ (se reposer) devant la télévision. 
5 Elles __ (se promener) dans la ville. 

6 Tu (se marier) quand?

S’amuser avec eux 

se coucher trés tard (to go to bed very late) 


Language points 


Using reflexive verbs in the passé 
compose 


Reflexive verbs take étre in the passé composé 


Nous nous sommes promenés en voiture. 
Je me suis régalé. 
Elle s’est mariée. 


Unit 9: We are enjoying ourselves 


As with our small group of verbs taking étre, the past participles 
in our examples agree in gender and number with the subject of 
the verb. Though it is always the case with verbs such as aller, 
venir, etc., with reflexive verbs, it is not always so. You will learn 
more about this in Unit 11. 

Ne... pas is placed on each side of the pronoun and @tre. 


Elle ne s’est pas reposée. 
Vous ne vous étes pas amusé(e)(s)? 


Exercise 6 


Can you tell when je, tu and vous represent a woman?

Writing to people 


Did you notice how Philippe and Christine started their card to 
Malika? In French, you can start a letter or a card to someone you 
know with cher(s), chére(s) and the name of the person you are 


118 


Unit 9: On s‘amuse bien 


addressing. Among young people and friends who know each other 
very well, salut is frequently used. 


Cher Matthieu 
Chére Sophie 


Chers amis 
Chéres amies 


Salut Max! 
Salut Héléne. 


You can also use cher(s) and chere(s) with the surname of a person 
you know but are not friends with: 


Cher Monsieur Dumas 
Chére Madame Leblanc 


When you do not know the person(s) you are writing to, you can 
either use monsieur, madame with their surname if you know it, 
or use monsieur, madame on their own. 

To end a letter to someone you know, you have several options, 
depending on how well you know him/her. Here are a few: 


amicalement or amitiés best wishes 
affectueusement fondly 
bises love 
je vous/t’?embrasse lots of love/hugs

musée de Cluny pour voir la Dame ala Licorne? C’est 
superbe. J’y vais une fois par an.

Expressing preferences 


To say what you would prefer or would rather have or do, you can 
use: 


Je préférerais aller au musée du Louvre. 
I'd rather go to the Louvre. 


Je préférerais un café. 
I’d rather have a coffee. 


J’aimerais mieux me promener dans les rues. 
I’d rather walk in the streets. 


J’aimerais mieux une glace au chocolat. 
I’d rather have a chocolate ice cream. 


As you can see, both can be followed by a noun or another verb 
in the infinitive. 

To ask about what someone would like to have or to do, you 
can use: 


Ca te dit? 
or 
Ca te tente? 


Both can be translated as ‘How about that?’, ‘Would you like 
that/to do that?’. 


Did you notice? 


Both Malika and Anne made suggestions of things they could do 
in Paris. They used a verb that you have already come across in 
Unit 7, pouvoir. Here, pouvoir is in the same form as aimer and 
préférer above. This form is called the conditional and you will 
learn more about it in future units. 


On pourrait visiter le musée d’Orsay. 
We could visit the Orsay museum. 


On pourrait manger dans le Quartier Latin.

Language points 
Using y 


The pronoun y can be used to replace phrases expressing a place 
and beginning with prepositions such as a, dans, sur, devant, 
derriére, chez. Pronouns such as y are always placed before the verb 
to which they relate. 


Mais est-ce que tu es déja allée au musée de Cluny pour voir 
la Dame a la Licorne? J’y vais une fois par an. 

But have you already been to the Cluny museum to see the 
Dame a la Licorne? I go there once a year. 


Unit 10: In Paris 


Whereas it is often possible in English to omit the pronoun ‘there’, 


Et puis, j’aime bien me balader sur les bords de la Seine. Ma 
meére et moi, nous y allons souvent quand elle vient a Paris. 
And I like to walk along the banks of the Seine. My mother 
and I often go there when she comes to Paris. 


Combien de temps est-ce qu’elle est restée a Paris? 
Elle y est restée trois jours, je crois. 


in French y is normally always present. 


When used in a negative sentence, the ne comes in front of y. 


J’ai cherché ces clés dans toute la maison et elles 
n’y sont pas. 

I’ve searched the whole house for those keys and 
they are not here. 


Tu es allée au musée de Cluny? 
Non, je n’y suis jamais allée. 


y is also used in phrases such as: 


On y va? On y va. 
Shall we go? We're off. 


Vas-y! or Allez-y! = Alllons-y! 
Go on! Let’s go.

La place du Tertre, ancienne place villageoise, accueille les 
touristes qui veulent se reposer aux multiples terrasses de café 
et aussi les chevalets des peintres qui cherchent a faire

au dos 
au bras 


I have a headache 
I have a toothache

142 Unit 11: Problemes de santé 


To say that you’ve hurt a part of your body, you can say: 


Je me suis fait mal au bras [ve hurt/hurt my arm 
au dos back 
au poignet wrist 
au genou knee 
a ’épaule shoulder 


You can also talk about specific injuries like this: 


Sylvia s’est cassé le bras. 
Sylvia broke/has broken her arm. 


Elle s’est foulé la cheville. 
She sprained/has sprained her ankle. 


Je me suis briilé le doigt. 
I burned/have burned my finger. 


Il s’est coupé au doigt. 
He cut/has cut his finger. 


Did you notice? 


All the verbs used above to talk about injuries are reflexive verbs. 
As you saw in Unit 9, when they are used in the passé composé, 
they usually agree in gender and number with the subject of the 
verb. Here, this is not the case. 


Sylvia s’est cassé le bras. 
Elle s’est foulé la cheville. 


This is because the verbs are followed by a direct object: le bras, 
la cheville. 

It’s not always easy for an English speaker to recognise a direct 
object. But the French occasionally have difficulties, too! 

The simplest way is to see if the subject and the verb are followed 
by something that answers the question quoi (what) or qui (who (m)): 


Sylvia s’est cassé quoi? le bras 
Sylvia has broken/broke what? 


Elle s’est foulé quoi? la cheville 
She has sprained/sprained what? 


Unit 11: Health problems 


Bernard a vu son docteur. 
Bernard a vu qui? 
Bernard saw who(m)? 


son docteur 


You will learn more about direct objects in later units. 


Minor ailments and symptoms 


J’ai la grippe.

golf. 

(c) Il ne peut rien manger. 

(d) Je ne peux pas conduire. 

(e) Je suis au lit depuis une 
semaine. 

(f) Je n’ai pas les idées 
claires. 


To give instructions you can use the imperative form of a verb:

Move your foot and toes. 


Evitez de marcher trop. 
Avoid walking too much. 


Continuez quand méme. 
Keep at it, still. 


143 


144

Revenez dans quinze jours, si ¢a ne va pas mieux. 
Come back in a fortnight, if it’s not better. 


Ne marchez pas sur l’herbe. 
Don’t walk on the grass. 


With relexive verbs, the reflexive form of the pronoun (se) is placed 
after the verb: 


Levez-vous! Couchez-vous de bonne heure. 
Get up! Go to bed early. 


To form the imperative, you simply remove the subject pronoun 
(vous, tu, nous) and use the verb in its present-tense form. Note 
that with most -er verbs, there will no -s in the tu form. 


Regarde! Look! 
(tu form: you are addressing someone that you know very well) 
Regardez! Look! 


(vous form: you are addressing a group of people or a person that 
you don’t well enough to address with the tu form) 


Regardons! Let’s have a look! 


In this unit, you will only practise the vous form of the imperative. 
You will learn more in Unit 14. 


Exercise 7 () (CD 2; 20) 


Christian is at the doctor’s explaining what’s wrong with him. Take 
the role of the doctor and give Christian instructions, using the 
imperative form of the verbs provided.

Unit 11: Health problems 


Cultural point 


You will not normally have to make an appointment if you need 
to consult un généraliste (GP). Until recently, visits to a doctor in 
France were normally charged directly to the patient. The French 
then claimed part, most or all of their money back from the Sécurité 
Sociale and Mutuelles (additional insurance cover). If given une 
ordonnance (a prescription) they would normally also need to pay 
for their medicines and claim part, most or all of their money back 
in the same way. Now, the introduction of an electronic card, la 
Carte Vitale, allows patients to be charged only for the difference 
not covered by their insurance, the doctor and chemist being paid 
directly by the Sécurité Sociale and relevant Mutuelles.

wheeled 

vehicle) 
voir to see tout a coup suddenly 
le pare-brise the windscreen éclater to shatter 
avoir peur to be scared la fin the end 


Language points 


Talking about the past with the 
impartait 


The imparfait (imperfect) is easy to form. You take the nous form 
of the verb in the present tense, remove the ending -ons and use 
what’s left as the stem. You then add the endings of the imparfait 
(-ais, -ais, -ait, -ions, -iez, -aient) to the stem as shown: 


aller — nous allons — stem: all- 


jallais 

tu allais 
il/elle/on allait 
nous allions 
vous alliez 
ils/elles allaient 


This pattern works for all verbs apart from one, étre which uses 
ét- as the stem. 


Nous étions en vacances. 


The imparfait is also easy to pronounce since four of the six forms 
(je, tu, il/elle/on, ils/elles) are pronounced in exactly the same way. 


You have already come across one tense (the passé composé) to 
talk about the past. 


Tout a coup le pare-brise a éclaté. 
Suddenly, the windscreen shattered. 


The imparfait can generally be translated in three ways but here 
too, relying on translation might prove very treacherous. 


Unit 12: Memories 


Je jouais au tennis, 

I used to play tennis. 

or 1 was playing tennis. 
or I played tennis. 


Use the imparfait when you are talking about something which is 
descriptive or provides a background to key events told in the passé 
composé. 


1 2 


Je regardais le match de football quand il est arrive. 
I was watching the football match when he arrived. 


where (1) is the background information and (2) is the key event. 


Uses of the imparfait can include: 
e what the weather was like: 


Il ne faisait vraiment pas beau. 
The weather really wasn’t good. 


e when or where it was: 


C’était en décembre. On était a Paris. 
It was in December. We were in Paris. 


¢ the characteristics of someone or something: 


Il était grand. On avait 22 ans, 
He was tall. We were 22 years old. 


La radio et le chauffage ne marchaient pas, le coffre ne 
fermait pas bien. 

The radio and the heating didn’t work and the boot didn’t 
shut properly. 


e the description of the setting or what was taking place at the 
time: 


Je ne pouvais pas doubler parce qu’il roulait assez vite. 
I couldn’t overtake because he was going quite fast. 


Exercise 1 () (CD 2; 22)

2 Il _ (partir) en vacances.

6 On (pouvoir) sortir tous les soirs. 
7 Vous (vouloir) devenir actrice? 

8 Nous (Ctre) fatigués.

Unit 12: Memories 


pleuvoir a lintérieur 

avoir un camion devant eux 
pas pouvoir doubler 

rouler assez vite 

le pare-brise éclater 


Language points 


Expressing the cause of something 
To introduce a cause, you can use parce que and 4 cause de. Parce 
que is always followed by a clause (subject + verb). 


Je ne pouvais pas doubler parce qu’1] roulait assez vite. 
I couldn’t overtake because he was going quite fast. 


Parce que is also closely linked with the question pourquoi. 


Pourquoi est-ce qu’il n’est pas 1a? 
Parce qu’il est malade. 


A cause de is normally followed by a noun or a pronoun. 
Et a cause de la pluie, je ne voyais pas grand-chose. 


And because of the rain, I couldn’t see much. 


Exercise 4 


Link the following facts with the corresponding cause, using parce 
que or a cause de. 


Il est resté au lit toute il avait un rendez-vous chez 
la journée un client 

La route est fermée le brouillard 

Il est parti de bonne heure il ne se sentait pas bien 

Il ne voyait pas grand-chose un accident 


Did you notice?

ALBERT: 


Vous étes né en 1925. Vous avez donc 80 ans 
aujourd’hui. Quels sont vos souvenirs d’enfance? 
Nous habitions a la campagne. Mon pere était 
agriculteur. I] n’y avait pas encore beaucoup de 
voitures a l’€poque. On se déplacait moins facile- 
ment. Mes fréres et moi allions 4 l’école a pied. On 
faisait bien 5 kilometres par jour pour aller au 
village. La vie était peut-étre plus dure par certains 
cotés, mais on vivait mieux qu’aujourd’hui. On 
prenait plus de temps pour faire les choses. Evidem- 
ment, mes parents avaient moins d’argent, mais on 
était heureux. 

Vous vous souvenez de la deuxieme guerre 
mondiale? 

Oui. Mon pére est entré dans la Résistance. Mes 
freres étaient fascinés. Moi, j’étais le plus jeune, je 
ne comprenais pas grand-chose. J’avais juste 15 ans 
et je m’intéressais plus aux filles qu’a la guerre. 
Quel est votre meilleur souvenir? 

La naissance de ma fille. J’étais a l’étranger pour 
affaires. Je présentais un projet a des clients poten- 
tiels. Tout se passait tres bien et puis j’ai eu la 
nouvelle de la naissance de ma fille en pleine réu- 
nion. J’étais tellement heureux, je n’arrivais plus a 
parler! J’ai expliqué pourquoi a tous ces hommes 
d’affaires et ils ont ri. Quand je suis retourné a mon 
hotel, le soir, il y avait une bouteille de champagne 
sur la table dans ma chambre avec une carte de

Language points 


Comparing with plus, moins, aussi 
You learned how to compare things by using plus, moins and aussi 


with adjectives: 


La vie était peut-étre plus dure par certains cotés. 
Life was maybe harder in some ways. 


The only exception concerns bon: 


Ton plat est meilleur. [you can say moins bon or 
Your dish is better. aussi bon but not ‘plus bon’] 


Meilleur will change to meilleure, meilleurs, meilleures according 
to the gender and number of the noun it is linked with. 


Unit 12: Souvenirs 


You can also use plus, moins and aussi with adverbs exactly in 
the same way: 


On se déplacait moins facilement. 
People moved around less easily. 


Il travaille plus rapidement qu'elle. 
He works more quickly than her. 


Ce camion roule aussi vite que nous. 
This lorry is going as fast as we are. 


The only exception concerns bien: 


On vivait mieux. [you can say moins bien and 
We lived better. aussi bien but not ‘plus bien’ | 
[life was better] 


Exercise 5 


Translate the following sentences. 


1 Life is harder. 4 My dessert is better. 
2 We travel more easily. 5 I go on holiday less often. 
3 I work as quickly. 6 It’s better.

Il mange toujours autant? 
Does he still eat as much/so much? 


You can use plus, moins, autant followed by de with nouns:

As you can see from the examples above, the French do not make 
a distinction between the comparative form (the younger) and the 
superlative form (the youngest). But you will need to select 
the right article (le, la, les) according to the gender and number of 
the noun it is linked with.

Dialogue 1 ¢) (co 2; 25 


Rendez-vous 


Anne is going to Grenoble for business purposes and plans to pay 
her friend Marc Bressot a vistt. 


ANNE: All6, est-ce que je pourrais parler 4 monsieur Bressot, 
Sil vous plait? 
EMPLOYEE: Oui, madame. Ne quittez pas. 


ANNE: All6é Marc? C’est Anne a l’appareil. 

MARC: Anne? Quel plaisir de vous entendre! Vous allez 
bien? 

ANNE: Trés bien, merci. Et vous? 

MARC: Pareillement, merci. 

ANNE: Marc, je serai a Grenoble la semaine prochaine et je 
me demandais... J’aimerais bien passer vous voir. 

MARC: Ca me ferait €normément plaisir! Quand est-ce que 
vous pouvez venir? 

ANNE: Je suis disponible mercredi matin et jeudi apres-midi. 

MARC: Alors, voyons. Je suis en réunion mercredi matin 


jusqu’a midi. Ah et malheureusement je suis en 


158 


Unit 13: Rendez-vous et invitations 


déplacement jeudi. Je vais voir des clients a Aix. Quel 
dommage! 

ANNE: Attendez! Je pourrais peut-étre trouver un moment 
mercredi en fin d’aprés-midi. Je suis tres occupée, 
mais je devrais étre libre vers 4 heures. Ca vous 


conviendrait? 
MARC: C’est parfait. 
ANNE: Je téléphonerai a votre secrétaire mercredi vers 


11 heures pour confirmer. 


Vocabulary 

ne quittez pas _ hold the line l’appareil (here) the phone 

pareillement the same, disponible free, available 
similarly 

une réunion a meeting un déplacement a (business) trip 

occupé busy libre free 

¢a vous conviendrait? would that be convenient for you? 


Language points 


Talking about the future with the 
simple future 


You already know how to talk about the future, using either the 
present tense or aller + verb in the infinitive. 


Je suis en réunion mercredi matin. 
I’m in a meeting Wednesday morning. 


Nous allons partir en France l’an prochain. 
We are going to go to France next year. 


These two forms are by far the most frequently used when you 
want to talk about future events. However, there is also a tense 
called the simple future. 


Je serai a Grenoble, la semaine prochaine. 
Ill be in Grenoble next week. 


Je téléphonerai a votre secrétaire mercredi vers 11 heures. 
I will ring your secretary on Wednesday at 11 o’clock. 


Unit 13: Appointments and invitations 


The simple future is normally confined to a certain number of situ- 
ations. Try to use it when what you are saying contains a certain 
amount of: 


* promise: 


Je ferai la vaisselle plus tard. 
I'll do the washing-up later. 


Je téléphonerai 4 votre secrétaire mercredi vers 11 heures. 
I'll ring your secretary on Wednesday at 11 o’clock. 


e prediction, or is easily calculable from dates, diary etc.: 


Il fera beau sur l’ensemble de la France. 
It will be sunny everywhere in France. 


Ma fille aura 20 ans en 2010. 
My daughter will be 20 in 2010. 


Je serai a Grenoble, la semaine prochaine. 
I'll be in Grenoble next week. 


How to form the simple future 


With most verbs, the simple future uses for its stem the part of the 
infinitive that comes before the -r. For instance the stem for aimer 
will be aime- and for vendre it will be vend-. You simply then add 
the following endings: -rai, -ras, -ra, -rons, -rez, -ront: 


jaimerai nous aimerons 
tu aimeras vous aimerez 
il, elle, on aimera ils, elles aimeront 


The endings never change but some verbs have an irregular stem. 
Here are the most useful ones: 


étre = se- re je serai 
avoir oe au- —t j’aurai 
faire = fe- > je ferai 
pouvoir > pour- =~ je pourrai 
vouloir = voud- => je voudrai 
devoir > dey- > je devrai 
aller ad i- — jiral 


venir > viend- —* je viendrai 


159 


160 


Unit 13: Rendez-vous et invitations 


voir = ver- = je verrai 
falloir — faud- cts il faudra 
savoir > sau- = je saurai 


Exercise 1 S (CD 2: 27) 


Put the verbs in brackets in the simple future. 


1 Nous (venir) l'année prochaine. 
2 Ti (partir) tout seul. 

3 Tu____ (faire) la vaisselle? 

4 Elles _ (devoir) travailler dur. 

5 J)_s (avoir) 35 ans dans deux ans. 
6 On (pouvoir) sortir tous les soirs. 
7 Vous (prendre) du poisson? 

8 Nous (étre) un peu en retard. 


Exercise 2 


You predict the future to a young friend of yours who is anxious 
to do well in his/her life. Play the part of the fortune-teller using 
the prompts below. 


rencontrer ’homme/la femme de ta vie 
avoir cing enfants 

gagner un million a la loterie 

arréter de travailler 

acheter plusieurs maisons en France 
vivre tres longtemps 


MA B&B WN = 


On 


Language points 


Using the conditional 


This is a tense you have already come across several times during 
the course. It has a significant number of uses but is largely known 
as the tense of the unreal. This is because more often than not it 
will allow you to present something that might or might not happen. 

With the verbs vouloir, pouvoir and aimer (mieux), it is 
often used to express a polite request, a wish, a preference or a 
suggestion: 


Unit 13: Appointments and invitations 


Je voudrais une baguette, s’il vous plait. (request) 
I'd like a baguette, please. 


Est-ce que je pourrais parler a monsicur Bressot, s’il vous 
plait? (request) 
Could | talk to Mr Bressot, please? 


On pourrait aller a la piscine. (suggestion) 
We could go to the swimming pool. 


J’aimerais bien passer vous voir. (wish) 
I’d like to come and see you. 


J’aimerais mieux aller au cinéma. (preference) 
I’d rather go to the cinema. 


With devoir, it is often used to give advice or express a close 
certainty: 


Tu devrais voir ton médecin. (advice) 
You should see your doctor. 


Je devrais étre libre vers 4 heures. (close certainty) 
I should/ought to be free around 4 o’clock. 


How to form the conditional 


Once you know how to form the simple future, it 1s very easy to 
form the conditional. The conditional uses exactly the same stem 
as the simple future. The endings for the conditional are: -rais, 
-rais, -rait, -rions, -riez, -raient. 


Je viendrais bien avec vous. 
I’d love to come with you. 


Nous serions tres heureux de vous recevoir. 
We would be very happy to have you. 


Ils aimeraient mieux travailler. 


They’d rather work. 


Exercise 3 () (CD 2: 29) 


Respond to the following situations, using the conditional. 


Example: J’ai mal aux dents. (give advice) 
Tu devrais aller chez le dentiste. 


161 


162 


Unit 13: Rendez-vous et invitations 


1 Je suis fatigué. 
(give advice) 


2 On va au cinéma? 
(express a preference to do something else) 


3 Je m’ennuie. 
(make a suggestion) 


4 J’ai envie de prendre un café. Et toi? 
(express your own wish) 


5 All6, agence de détectives Marlowe. 
(politely request to talk to a detective) 


Language points 


Talking about your availability 


To talk about your availability, you can use the following struc- 
tures: 


Je suis libre demain matin. 
I’m free tomorrow morning. 


M. Martin est disponible toute la journée. 
Mr. Martin is available all day. 


Mme Deschamps est occupée. 
Mrs Deschamps is busy. 


You can also use: 


Mare est en réunion toute la matinée. 
Marc is in a meeting all morning. 


Je suis en déplacement la semaine prochaine. 
I’m on a business trip next week. 


Pierre est en congés. 
Pierre is on (annual) leave.

Anne ts still in Grenoble visiting some clients. One of them, Philippe, 
would like to invite her for a coffee. 


PHILIPPE: Vous avez le temps de prendre un café? 

ANNE: C’est gentil, Philippe. Je regrette, mais j’ai un rendez- 
vous dans un quart d’heure. 

PHILIPPE: Peut-étre plus tard, alors. Je serai libre vers 5 heures. 
On pourrait prendre un verre ensemble. 

ANNE: Vous savez, je suis débordée aujourd’hui. Ca risque 
d’étre difficile. 

PHILIPPE: Demain alors? 

ANNE: Euh, c’est a dire que j’ai des réunions toute la 
journée. Je ne vois pas quand j’aurai un moment.

diner avec vous, si j’avais le temps. Ecoutez, si je finis 
avant huit heures, je vous appellerai. 


Vocabulary 

prendre un to have a drink débordé snowed under 
verre with work 

un rapport a report avoir le temps __ to have (the) time 


Language points 


Expressing a condition 
To express a condition, you can use the following structures with si: 


e when a possible event relies on something that has not yet 


happened: 
si + present , simple future 


Si je finis avant huit heures, je vous appellerai. 
If I finish before 8, I will call you. 


Tu auras un dessert, si tu manges tes légumes. 
You'll have a dessert, if you eat your vegetables. 


The tense in the main clause is often the simple future but you can 
also find the umperative as for example in Dialogue 2 of Unit 11, 
the present tense or aller + verb in the infinitive. 


e when a hypothetical event relies on something that is not true/ 
real at the time: 


si + imparfait , conditional 


Unit 138: Appointments and invitations 165 


J’aimerais beaucoup sortir diner avec vous, si j’avais le temps. 
I would love to go out for a meal with you, if I had time. 


Si tu travaillais plus, tu aurais de meilleurs résultats. 
If you worked more, you would have better results. 


In both cases si becomes s’ when used with il: 


S’il fait beau, nous irons a la plage. 
If it’s sunny, we'll go to the beach. 


S’il faisait beau, nous irions a la plage. 
If it were sunny, we would go to the beach. 


Exercise 5 () (CD 2; 31) 


A une condition! Some of your friends have made a few sugges- 
tions to you, but your answers depend on conditions. Make 
sentences, following the example. 


Example: Je viendrai avec vous a la campagne

2 Une sortie au cinéma (ne pas finir trop tard au travail) 
3 Une sortie au restaurant (ne pas étre fatigué) 

4 Des vacances (pouvoir prendre des congés) 

5 Une journée a Paris (étre libre) 

Exercise 6

166 


Unit 13: Rendez-vous et invitations 


You can use this structure si + imparfait + ? to make a suggestion 
or propose something. 


Si on allait au cinéma?

expressions relating to cooking 


Dialogue 1 ( ) (co 2;32) 


Une ratatouille reussie 


Chantal and Jacques have invited a couple of friends, Daniel and 
Elise, for a barbecue. We join the two women as Chantal explains 
to Elise how to make ratatouille. 


ELISE: Qu’est-ce que tu prépares de bon? 

CHANTAL: Une ratatouille pour aller avec les cétes de porc et 
les merguez. Ca va, non? 

ELISE: Mmm, j’adore la ratatouille, mais je ne sais vraiment 
pas la faire. C’est difficile? 

CHANTAL: Non. Théoriquement tu dois faire cuire tous les 
légumes séparément mais moi, je ne le fais pas. 

ELISE: Comment tu fais alors? 

CHANTAL: Je fais d’abord revenir mes oignons dans de l’huile 
d’olive et puis j’ajoute les courgettes et les aubergines. 

ELISE: Tu les mets au méme moment? 

CHANTAL: Oui et tu les fais cuire un peu a feu moyen. Et apres, 
tu ajoutes les tomates. 

ELISE; Tu les a épluchées? 


Unit 14: A weekend spent cooking 169 


CHANTAL: Oui, parce que Jacques n’aime pas la peau des 
tomates. 

ELISE: Et c’est tout? 

CHANTAL: Non, tu sales et tu poivres. Et tu mets du thym, 
du persil et une feuille de laurier. Voila. Maintenant, 
on laisse mijoter 20 minutes. Bon, on a le temps de 
prendre un petit apéritif avec les hommes.

Language points 


Talking about cooking 


The French love to talk about cooking. In Dialogue 1, Chantal uses 
the present tense to explain to Elise how to make a ratatouille. She 
uses the following verbs to talk about the recipe: faire cuire, faire 
revenir, ajouter, mettre, éplucher, saler, poivrer, laisser mijoter. 


170 Unit 14: Un week-end passé a cuisiner 


Here are a few more useful verbs you may need: 


Vous coupez les tomates en quatre. 
You cut the tomatoes tn four. 


Tu mélanges bien. 
You mix well. 


Tu verses la pate dans un moule a gateaux. 
You pour the mixture into a cake tin. 


Vous faites griller les steaks? 
Are you grilling the steaks? 


Elle fait bouillir Peau pour les pates. 
She’s boiling the water for the pasta. 


Exercise 1 


When you look up a recipe in French cookery books, you will see 
that verbs tend to be in the infinitive. Here’s the recipe for a 
vegetable flan. Explain the recipe to a friend, using the present 
tense. 


Flan de legumes 


3 courgettes 

2 tomates bien grosses 
2 ceufs 

1 litre de lait 

sel 

poivre 

cumin 


paprika 


Préchauffer le four a 200 degrés. Couper les courgettes et les 
tomates en tranches d’un demi-centimétre. Dans un moule a flans, 
alterner une rangeée de courgettes et une rangee de tomates. 
Meélanger les ceufs au lait. Ajouter une pincée de sel, un peu de 
poivre, une cuillére a café de cumin et de paprika. Verser le mélange 
dans le moule. Mettre au four. Laisser cuire une heure.

Language points 


Using the pronouns |e, la, les 


Like all pronouns le, la, les are used to avoid repeating something 
which has already been mentioned. Like all pronouns, they are 
usually placed just before the verb they relate to. When used in 
the negative, the ne comes just before le, la or les. 


le usually replaces a masculine singular noun 
la replaces a feminine singular noun 
les replaces a plural noun 


Because they replace something which comes directly after the verb, 
something which is not preceded by a preposition such as a or de 
for example, they are called direct object pronouns. 


Je prépare lapéritif. — Je le prépare. 
Je ne fais pas la vaisselle. => Je ne Ja fais pas. 
Je regarde Jes informations. “s Je les regarde. 
but 

Je pense a@ mes vacances. oe J’y pense. 


In later units, you will come across indirect object pronouns; but 
in this unit, you will only work with verbs taking direct object 
pronouns. Here are a few examples from Dialogue 1: 


Oui et tu les fais cuire un peu a feu moyen. 
(les aubergines et les courgettes) 
Yes, and you cook them a little on a low heat. 


Tu les a épluchées? (les tomates) 
Did you peel them? 


172 Unit 14: Un week-end passé a cuisiner 


J’adore la ratatouille, mais je ne sais pas vraiment la faire. 
(la ratatouille) 
I love ratatouille, but I don’t really know how to make it. 


On le prend sur la terrasse? 
(l’apéritif) 
Are we having it on the terrace? 


Le and la will drop the -e and -a in front of a verb starting with a 
vowel or an h. 


Il restait une pomme, non? Wasn’t there an apple left? 
Je /’ai mangée, hier. I ate it yesterday. 


Did you notice? 


When you use la or les with a verb in the passé composé, the past 
participle agrees in gender and number with la (feminine singular) 
or les (masculine or feminine plural). 


Tu les a épluchées? (les tomates) 
Non, je ne Jes ai pas épluchées. 


Ou sont les verres a whisky? 
Where are the whisky glasses? 


Je les ai rangés dans le buffet. 
I put them in the sideboard. 


Et la nappe? 
What about the tablecloth? 


Je l’ai mise dans le buffet aussi. 
I put it in the sideboard, too. 


Exercise 2 


Read again the recipe in Exercise 1. What do the pronouns in 
italics replace? 


1 On le préchauffe a 200 degrés. 

On /es coupe en tranches. 

On les mélange au lait. 

On Ja verse dans le moule. 

On /e met au four et on /e laisse cuire une heure. 


On & WN

Language points 


Using en 


En is another pronoun which allows you to avoid repeating some 
information. En normally replaces a noun preceded by de, du, de 
la, des. Like y, le, la, les, it is normally placed directly before the 
verb. 


Vous avez des tomates? 

Oui, j’en ai. 

J’en ai acheté juste pour toi. (du whisky) 
I bought some just for you. 


En can also be used when the noun it replaces is preceded by 
expressions of quantity such as un, une, deux, trois, etc., un peu 


176 


Unit 14: Un week-end passé a cuisiner 


de, beaucoup de, assez de, un verre de, un kilo de, plusieurs, 
quelques, une dizaine, etc. In cases like this, the expression of quan- 
tity will follow the verb. 


Vous avez une voiture? 
Oui, Jen ai une. 


Vous voulez de la tarte? 
Oui, j’en veux un peu, s’il vous plait. (un peu de tarte) 


Tu en verses juste un peu. (un peu de charbon de bois) 
You just put some of it. 


Il prend du vin aux repas? 
Oui, il en prend un verre a tous les repas. (un verre de vin) 


Vous voulez des pommes? 

Oui, j’en prendrai une dizaine, s’il vous plait. 
(une dizaine de pommes) 

Yes, Pll have about ten, please. 


Approximate numbers 


une dizaine une quinzaine 
une vingtaine une trentaine 
une quarantaine une cinquantaine 
une soixantaine une centaine 


une douzaine = exactly 12 


En is also frequently used with some expressions such as: 


J’en ai marre! (du travail, de la pluie, des enfants) 
I’m fed up! (with work, rain, the children) 


J’en ai bien besoin! (in Dialogue 2, d’un apéritif) 
I really need it! 


Exercise 5 () (CD 2; 35) 


Answer the questions, following the example. 


Example: Vous avez du pain? 
Oui, j’en ai. 


Unit 14: A weekend spent cooking

3 Vous voulez de la tarte au citron?

4 Vous mangez souvent des légumes?

5 Vous avez acheté du pain pour ce soir?

tity as in the example. 


Example: Vous avez combien de paires de chaussures? 
J’en ai une cinquantaine. Or: J’en ai beaucoup.

Giving instructions with the 

imperative 

You have already encountered the imperative in Unit 11. The 
imperative is used to give instructions. There are three forms: 


Prends ce papier journal. (tu form) 
Take this newspaper. 


Venez avec nous. (vous form) 
Come with us. 


Partons a \a plage. (nous form) 
Let’s go to the beach. 


177 


178 


Unit 14: Un week-end passé a cuisiner 


If you need to use a pronoun such as le, la, les, en or y, remember 
that it will be placed straight after the verb, unless the sentence is 
in the negative. 


Froisse-/e un peu et pose-/e sur les cendres. 
Crumple it a little and put it on the ashes. 


Laisse-les. Vas-y. 
Leave them. Go on. 


Prenez-en un morceau. 
Take a piece. 


Ne Je mets pas tout d’un coup. 
Don’t put it all at once. 


As explained in Unit 11, most verbs use the present tense to form 
the imperative. But there are exceptions. Here are two: étre and 
avoir. 


Sois gentil! (tu form) 
Be good! 


Soyez préts a huit heures. = (vous form) 
Be ready at eight. 


Aie de la patience. (tu form) 
Be patient. 


A yez du courage! (vous form)

Talking about colours, material and size 


To talk about colours, materials and sizes, you can use the following 


en + colour / material / size 


structure: 


Je voudrais cette chemise en blanc. 
I’d like this shirt in white. 


Je vais avoir ce modéle en rose pale, blanc ou bleu ciel. 
I'll have this style in pale pink, white or sky blue.

J’ai aussi ce modeéle en 70% coton et 30% acrylique. 
I also have this style in 70% cotton and 30% acrylic. 


Nous avons ce pull en S. 
We have this jumper in Small. 


Alors en L, je vais avoir ce modéle. 
So in Large, I have this style. 


Colours can be nouns as in the above construction or adjectives. 
Unless you are using the above construction with en or are talking 
about the colour in general, and in that case the noun will be 
masculine singular, both adjectives and nouns will vary in gender 
and number with what they refer to. 


Je voudrais une chemise blanche. (adjective) 
I'd like a white shirt. 


J’aime beaucoup cette fleur rose. Qu’est-ce que c’est? 
(adjective) 
I like this pink flower very much. What is it? 


J’adore Je noir! (noun: the colour) 
I love black. 


Alors, ce sera la noire ou la bordeaux. 
(nouns: the shirts defined by their colour) 
So, it will be the black (one) or the burgundy (one). 


Note that there are some exceptions. When a colour is derived 
from a fruit, a stone, a plant, a substance, a wine such as bordeaux 
for instance, the colour will not vary in gender and number. 


J’adore ces roses orange. 
I love these orange roses. 


Cultural point 


Though the French have their own numbering system for sizes, 
most clothes and shoes labels now include the equivalent size for 
the UK, Germany, Italy and the US. As in most countries, sizes 
for clothes tend to be reduced to S for small, M for medium, 
L for large and XL for extra large. Half sizes for shoes are not 
uncommon, so it is worth asking.

Language points 


Using lequel, lesquels ... celui-cl, 
celui-la 


Lequel, laquelle, lesquels, lesquelles are used to ask the question 
‘which one(s)’. 

Since they stand for a noun, they change their form according 
to the gender (masculine or feminine) and the number (singular or 
plural) of the noun(s) they refer to. 

Celui-ci, celui-la, celle-ci, celle-la, ceux-ci, ceux-la, celles-ci, 
celles-la are often used to answer the question starting with lequel, 
laquelle, etc. and can be translated by ‘this/that one’, ‘these/those 
ones’. Like lequel, laquelle ... they change their form according 
to the gender and number of the noun(s) they refer to.

Unit 15: Clothes and shoes 187 


The French are not very particular about the difference between 
this and that, these and those. They will often prefer to use celui- 
la or celle-la, ceux-la or celles-la when in English you would use 
this one or these ones. 


J’aime bien ce chapeau. 
I like this hat. 


Lequel? 
Which one? 


Cette jupe me plait bien. 
I like this skirt. 


Moi, je préfere celle-Id.

Language points 


Using the relative pronouns qui, que 


and ou 


The relative pronouns qui and que relate either to persons or to 
things in order to provide additional information about the person(s) 


Unit 16: Looking for a house 


or thing(s), much like an adjective would. Both qui and que can be 
translated by ‘who(m)’, ‘which’, ‘that’ or nothing! 

In French the use of qui and que depends on the grammatical 
relation between the word(s) coming before them and the verb that 
follows them. Unlike their English equivalents, qui and que cannot 
be omitted in French. 

Because qui is the subject of the verb that follows it, you cannot 
use, for example, je, tu, il, elle, etc., after it. 


Jolie maison neuve qui offre une surface habitable 
de 120 m’. 

Attractive new house that/which offers a surface area 
of 120 m?’. 


C’est la dame qui dirige la nouvelle agence immobiliére. 
It’s the woman who runs the new estate agency. 


Because que is the object of the verb that follows it, it is always 
followed by a subject (for example je, tu, il, elle, etc.) and its verb. 


C’est une annonce que j’ai trouvée sur internet. 
It is an advert (that/which) I found on the internet. 


Je vais te présenter a quelqu’un que tu ne connais pas. 
I am going to introduce you to someone (that/whom) 
you don’t know. 


Note that, when used with a verb in the passé composé, the past 
participle of the verb following que will agree in gender and number 
with the noun(s) it relates to. The noun(s) are underlined in the 
examples below. 


C’est une femme que j’ai connue a Paris. 
Les fruits gue tu as achetés sont tres bons. 


The relative pronoun ou usually relates to a place and can be trans- 
lated as ‘where’. 


Elle est a cing minutes d’un petit village ou on trouve toutes 
les commodités, 

It’s five minutes from a little village where you can find all 
amenities. 


C’est le bureau ou je travaille. 
It’s the office where I work.

Language points 


Expressing wishes, preferences and 
obligation with the subjunctive 


You already know how to use the following verbs expressing 
wishes, preferences or obligation with another verb in the infinitive. 


J’aimerais (bien/mieux) aller au cinéma. 
Il voudrait devenir architecte. 


Nous voulons acheter une maison. 
Nous avons envie de faire du frangais. 


206 


Unit 17: On discute de la maison 


Je préfére aller au restaurant. 
Il faut tout refaire. 


You can use the verbs or expressions above followed by que (that) 

very much like the verbs penser, croire or trouver you encountered 

in the previous unit. Using que allows you to introduce another 

subject different from the one you are using with the first verb. 
Compare the following two sets of sentences: 


Je pense changer de travail. (one subject throughout: je) 
I am thinking of changing jobs. 


Je pense que tu as raison. (two subjects: je and tu) 
I think (that) you are right. 


Il veut rester a Paris. (one subject: il) 
He wants to stay in Paris. 


Il veut qu’elles travaillent plus. (two subjects: il and elles) 
He wants them to work more. 


Whenever you want to use verbs expressing wishes or preferences 
such as vouloir, aimer, avoir envie, préférer or when you want to 
use falloir (as in il faut or il faudrait) followed by que, the verb 
after que will be in a new form called the subjunctive. As you saw 
in the previous unit, this is gencrally not the case for penser, croire 
and trouver. 

Using the subjunctive is not a refinement. All French people use 
it. Generally it is not difficult to use because it tends to come with 
specific verbs or expressions that you can easily memorise. In this 
course, you will only learn how to use it with falloir and verbs 
expressing wishes or preferences. 


J’aimerais qu’on réfléchisse bien. 
I would like us to think about it carefully. 


Il faudrait qu’on fasse pas mal de travaux. 
We would need to make quite a few alterations. 


Il faut qu’on regarde notre budget de pres. 
We need/have to look at our budget closely. 


Je ne voudrais pas que nous ayons des problémes d’argent. 
I would not like us to have money problems. 


Je n’ai pas envie que tu ne puisses plus dépenser de petites 
fortunes dans les magasins! 

I would not like you not to be able to spend a small fortune in 
the shops, anymore! 


Unit 17: Talking about the house 207 


How to form the subjunctive 


For most verbs, simply take out the -ent of the ils/elles form of the 
verb in the present tense and add to the stem (what’s left of the 
verb) the following endings, as shown in the example with partir: 
e, eS, e, ions, iez, ent. 


ils/elles partent -—> part -ent — _ part (stem) 


The verb partir 


que je parte que nous partions 
que tu partes que vous partiez 
que il/elle/on parte que ils/elles partent 


There are a few exceptions. Here are some you need to know. 
Look them up in the reference grammar at the end of the book: 
aller, vouloir, pouvoir, faire, venir, étre and avoir. 


Exercise 1 () (CD 2: 47) 


Fill in the gaps with the correct form of the verb in brackets. 


1 Il faut que nous _ (partir) de bonne heure. 


2 Je voudrais que tu (venir) avec moi. 

3 Jaimerais mieux quils _ (faire) leur travail. 
4 Elle ne veut pas que vous (finir) tard. 

5 II faudrait que nous (avoir) plus de temps. 
Exercise 2 


Infinitive or que + subjunctive? Translate the following sentences. 


1 I want you to come with us. 

2 She needs to buy some butter. 

3 He would like to go on holiday. 
4 We’d rather he looks for a job. 
5 They have to buy another house.

Language points 


Talking about events in the past with 
pendant 


You can use pendant + duration (e.g. deux heures, trois mois, 
quelques années, etc.) to say for how long an event went on in the 
past. Pendant is then normally translated by ‘for’ in English. The 
tense of the verb used in French will normally be the passé 
composé. The event you are talking about is over. 


M. et Mme Breton ont négligé pas mal de choses pendant 
trop d’années. 

M. et Mme Breton neglected quite a few things for too many 
years. 


J’ai attendu le train pendant quatre heures. 
I waited for the train for four hours. 


Pendant des siécles, on a cru que le soleil tournait autour 

de la terre. 

For centuries, it was believed that the sun revolved around the 
earth.

Language points 


Using verbs with and without a 
preposition 


In Unit 11, you learned how to recognise a direct object. More 
often than not, a verb in French will be followed by its object(s). 
Objects can be direct or indirect. It depends on whether or not the 
verb used with its object(s) is followed by a preposition or not. 

When the verb used with its object(s) is not followed by a prep- 
osition, we have a direct object construction. 


Elle écoute les informations tous les soirs. (direct) 
She listens to the news every evening. 


Mon mari et moi attendons sa réponse avec 
impatience. (direct) 
My husband and IJ are waiting for her answer impatiently. 


Unit 17: Talking about the house 211 


When the verb used with its object(s) is followed by a preposition 
(such as a), we have an indirect object construction. Though there 
are others, the most common preposition used in French is 
normally a. 


Elle téléphone a ses amis de temps en temps. (indirect) 
She phones her friends now and again. 


Vous voulez que je demande a Mme Breton de 
vous contacter? (indirect) 
Do you want me to ask Mme Breton to contact you? 


Exercise 5 


Direct or indirect object constructions? 


Elle parle a sa sceur. 

Tu invites Marc, ce soir? 

J’ai vu les amis de Sandra. 
J’écris rarement a mes collégues.

Unit 17: On discute de la maison 


Language points 


Using the pronouns le, |a, les and lui, 
leur 


In Unit 14, you came across the pronouns le, la, and les and used 
them to avoid the repetition of things previously mentioned. 


L’apéritif, on /e prend sur la terrasse? 
You can also use le, la, les to talk about people. 


J’ai essayé de Ja rappeler hier. (Mme Breton) 
I tried to ring her again yesterday. 


Patrick? Non je ne /e vois pas aujourd’hui. (Patrick) 
Patrick? No, I’m not seeing him today. 


Ils invitent ses parents souvent? 

Oui, ils /es invitent tous les dimanches, (ses parents) 
Does he invite his parents often? 

Yes, he invites them every Sunday. 


Le, la, les are only used in direct object construction. This is why 
they are called direct object pronouns. 


le replaces someone male/something masculine singular 
la replaces someone female/something feminine singular 


les replaces more than one person (male or 
female)/something in the plural 


Remember that le and la will become I in front of a word starting 
with a vowel or an ‘h’. 

Lui, leur are also pronouns but unlike le, la, les they are are 
only used to talk about people (and animals). And because they 
are only used in indirect object construction (generally with a), they 
are called indirect object pronouns. 


Vous lui avez parlé? (a Mme Breton) 
Did you talk to her? 


Je peux /eur demander de passer la voir. 
(a mes deux collégues) 
I can ask them to go and See her. 


Unit 17: Talking about the house 


lui replaces someone male or female 
leur replaces more than one person (male or female) 


Both the direct object pronouns le, la, les and the indirect object 
pronouns lui, leur are generally placed before the verb they are 
linked with. 

As you can see, ‘him’ can be translated by le or lui, ‘her’ by la 
or lui, and ‘them’ by les or leur, depending on the verb you are 
using them with. 

But what about ‘me’, ‘you’, ‘us’? 

Regardless of the verb you use them with, ‘me’, ‘you’ and ‘us’ 
are always translated by the same word. 


Il me parle souvent. Je te téléphone. 

He talks to me often. I'll phone you. 

Il nous regarde manger. Je vais vous expliquer. 

He is watching us eat. I’m going to explain (it) to you. 


So, to summarise, here is the full list of direct and indirect object 
pronouns: 


Direct object Indirect object 


pronouns pronouns 
me me 

te te 

le, la lui 

nous nous 
vous vous 

les leur 


Did you notice? 


When you use lui or leur with a verb in the passé composé, the 
past participle does not agree in gender and number with the 
noun(s) lui or leur replace. 


Je lui ai téléphoné tout de suite aprés votre appel. 
(a Mme Breton) 


Je leur ai téléphoné, mais ils ne sont pas 1a.

Some formal forms of address 


The French can be quite formal in some situations. You might find 
the following expressions useful. 


Je suis ravi(e) de vous dire que Mme Breton a accepté 
votre offre. 

I am delighted to tell you that Mme Breton has accepted 
your Offer. 


220 


Unit 18: Négociations 


Je me permets de vous suggérer de contacter votre notaire 
rapidement. 
May I suggest you get in touch with your solicitor quickly? 


Si vous voulez bien fixer un rendez-vous avec votre notaire... 
If you could arrange a meeting with your solicitor... 


Veuillez s’il vous plait, laisser un message ou nous rappeler 
plus tard. 
Please leave a message or call us again later. 


Other useful expressions are: 


Je suis vraiment navré(e) de vous annoncer que vous avez 
échoué a votre examen. 

I am really sorry to have to tell you that you have failed at 
your examinations. 


Je vous remercie de votre cadeau. 
I thank you for your present. 


Je vous prie de m’envoyer vos tarifs. 
Please send me your list of prices. 


And if you need to end a formal letter to someone you don’t know 
personally, here are two formulae you could use: 


Veuillez agréer, Monsieur, l’expression de mes sentiments les 
meilleurs. 


Je vous prie de croire, Madame, a l’assurance de mes 
salutations distinguées. 


There are endless variations on these two examples above, but all 
can be translated by ‘yours sincerely’ or ‘yours faithfully’. 

However, you can use something shorter if, for example, you 
send an email: 


Veuillez recevoir mes sincéres salutations. 
Sincéres salutations.

Nouns in French are either maculine or feminine. Because gender 

is carried by the noun, it affects words around it, such as articles 

and adjectives. 
The mark of the feminine for an adjective is usually an -e. There 

are exceptions. The most useful ones are listed in Unit 7. 

The mark of the plural for both nouns and adjectives is usually an 


-s. Again there are exceptions. 


Nouns ending in -au, -eau and -eu normally have an -x in the plural: 


un chapeau 
un feu 


des chapeaux 
des feux 


Nouns ending in -al normally have their plural in -aux: 


un cheval 


des chevaux 


Reference grammar 225 


Negative sentences 
Negative words such as ne... paS, ne... jamais, ne... plus or ne 
. rien are usually placed on either side of the verb: 


Il n’aime pas le café. 
Elle ne travaille jamais. 


Il n’est plus venu. 
Ils ne veulent rien faire. 


Questions 


Questions are usually formed in two ways: 


Tu veux venir? (rising intonation) 
Est-ce que tu veux venir? (using est-ce que) 
Vous venez quand? (rising intonation) 
Quand est-ce que vous venez? (using est-ce que) 


Verbs and tenses 


The present tense 


Nearly all verbs have the following endings: 


Je e or Ss 
Tu es or Ss 
Il e or t 


Nous’ ons 
Vous ez 
Ils ent 


Exceptions include: étre, avoir, faire, aller, pouvoir, vouloir and 
verbs ending in -dre. 

Most verbs ending in -er follow the chercher model. For other 
verbs, there are other models. We have provided the most useful 
models below. The list is by no means exhaustive but provides you 
with a good starting point.

This tense is formed by conjugating avoir or étre in the present 
tense and adding the past participle form of the verb you want to 
use. Most verbs use avoir. 
All reflexive verbs and a few other verbs listed below use étre. 
Verbs using étre: naitre, mourir, aller, venir, entrer, sortir,

Reference grammar 231 


Useful past participles 


All verbs ending in -er have their past participle in -é; others don’t. 
Here is a list of the most useful: 


attendre attendu mourir mort 
avoir eu offrir offert 
boire bu ouvrir ouvert 
conduire conduit partir parti 
connaitre connu plaire plu 
construire construit pleuvoir plu 
croire cru pouvoir pu 
culre cuit prendre pris 
découvrir découvert recevoir recu 
descendre descendu répondre répondu 
devenir devenu rire ri 
devoir da sentir senti 
dire dit servir servi 
dormir dormi sortir sorti 
écrire écrit suivre suivi 
entendre entendu tenir tenu 
étre été vendre vendu 
faire fait venir venu 
falloir fallu vivre vécu 
interdire interdit Voir vu 

lire lu vouloir voulu 
mettre mis 


The imperfect or |'imparfait 


This tense is easily formed by using the nous form of the present 
tense of the verb. Simply remove the -ons ending and use the 
remaining stem throughout the conjugation, adding the endings: 
-aiS, -aiS, -ait, -ions, -iez, -aient. 

Example: 


vendre nous vend -ons 


232 Reference grammar 


vendre 


je vendais 

tu vendais 

il vendait 
nous vendions 
vous vendiez 


ils vendaient 


The simple future 


With most verbs, the simple future uses for its stem the part of the 
infinitive that comes before the r. For instance the stem for aimer 
will be aime- and for vendre it will be vend-. You simply then add 
the endings: -rai, -ras, -ra, -rons, -rez, -ront. 


descendre 


je descendrai 

tu descendras 

il descendra 

nous descendrons 
vous descendrez 


ils descendront 


Some verbs have an irregular stem. Here are the most useful ones: 


étre =e se- = je seral 
avoir > au- > j aural 
faire = fe- > je ferai 
pouvoir => pour- > je pourrai 
vouloir = voud- = je voudrai 
devoir == dev- = je devral 
aller > I- > j iral 
venir = viend- na je viendrai 
voir ed ver- => je verrai 
falloir = faud- = il faudra 
savoir =+ sau- > je saurai 


Reference grammar 233 


The conditional 


The conditional uses exactly the same stem as the simple future. 
The list of verbs with an irregular stem is the same as for the simple 
future. The endings for the conditional are: -rais, -rais, -rait, -rions, 
-riez, -raient. 


descendre 

je descendrais nous descendrions 
tu descendrais vous descendriez 
il descendrait ils descendraient 


The subjunctive 


For most verbs, simply remove the -ent from the ils/elles form of 
the verb in the present tense and add to the stem the following 
endings as shown in the example with partir: -e, -es, -e, -ions, -iez, 
-ent. 


Example: 

partir Ils part -ent 
partir 
que je parte que nous partions 
que tu partes que vous partiez 
qu’il parte qu’ils partent 


Here are a few exceptions: 


avoir étre 

que j’aie que je sois 

que tu aies que tu sois 

qu’il ait qu’il soit 

que nous ayons que nous soyons 
que vous ayez que vous soyez 


qu’ils aient qu’ils soient 


234 


aller 


que j/aille 

que tu ailles 
qu'il aille 

que nous allions 
que vous alliez 


qu’ils aillent 


vouloir 


que je veuille 

que tu veuilles 
qu’il veuille 

que nous voulions 
que vous vouliez 


qu ils veuillent 


venir 


que je vienne 
que tu viennes 
qu'il vienne 

que nous venions 
que vous veniez 


quils viennent 


Reference grammar 


faire 


que je fasse 

que tu fasses 
qu’il fasse 

que nous fassions 
que vous fassiez 


qu’ils fassent 


pouvoir 


que je puisse 

que tu puisses 
qu’il puisse 

que nous puissions 
que vous puissiez 


qu’ils puissent 


The imperative 


It has only three persons (tu, nous and yous). For most verbs, it is 
similar to the present tense. For all verbs ending in -er, there is no 
‘s’? in the tu form except when the verb is followed by en or y. 


Chercher 


cherche 
cherchons 


cherchez 


Reference grammar 235 


But: 
Cherches-en! Vas-y! 


For avoir and étre the imperative is similar to the subjunctive. 


avoir étre
