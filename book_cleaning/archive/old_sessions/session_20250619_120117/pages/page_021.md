## Unit: Regular -er Verbs

**Habiter**, **travailler** and **parler** are **-er** verbs, so-called because their infinitive (the form under which you will find them in any dictionary) ends in **-er**. Most **-er** verbs are regular in the way that they change their form according to the person (**je**, **tu**, **il**, **elle**, etc.) they are used with. Since most French verbs are **-er** verbs, it is useful to try to memorise the model below. For regular **-er** verbs such as **travailler**, you simply need to take off the **-er** and add the endings as shown.

**travailler** (to work)
- **Je** travaill**e**
- **Tu** travaill**es**
- **Il** travaill**e**
- **Elle** travaill**e**
- **Nous** travaill**ons**
- **Vous** travaill**ez**
- **Ils** travaill**ent**
- **Elles** travaill**ent**

Note that **je** will drop its **e** in front of a vowel or an **h** e.g. j'habite. The forms travaill**e**, travaill**es** and travaill**ent** are pronounced in the same way.

Here are a few other verbs which work in exactly the same way:

- **téléphoner** _to phone_
- **écouter** _to listen_
- **regarder** _to look_
- **arriver** _to arrive_
- **aimer** _to like/love_

You should practise conjugating them.
