## Language points - Asking questions

The simplest way to ask a question in French is to use intonation. When asking a question, your voice must have a rising intonation at the end of the sentence to distinguish it from a statement.

**Vous êtes français.**
_You are French._
(statement)

**Vous êtes français?**
_Are you French?_
(question)

### Did you notice?

When the taxi-driver asked Anne if she was English, he said:
**Vous êtes anglaise?**
_Are you English?_
(CD 1; 2)

This is called a **liaison**. Liaisons are a feature of French pronunciation. There are some rules, but the easiest way is to try to imitate what you hear as much as you can.

## Language points - Giving more information about yourself

Anne is Scottish, but what else do we know about her?

**Elle habite en Angleterre, à Coventry.**
_She lives in England, in Coventry._

**Elle travaille à Londres.**
_She works in London._

**Elle parle bien français.**
_She speaks good French._

Verbs in French change their form according to the person (**je**, **tu**, **il**, **elle**, etc.) they are used with. This is called conjugation. We have provided you with more information on how verbs are conjugated in the reference grammar.
