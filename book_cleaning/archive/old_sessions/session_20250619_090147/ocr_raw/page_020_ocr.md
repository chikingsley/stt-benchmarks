## Asking questions

The simplest way to ask a question in French is to use intonation. When asking a question, your voice must have a rising intonation at the end of the sentence to distinguish it from a statement.

Vous êtes français.
(statement)
Vous êtes français?
(question)

## Did you notice?

When the taxi-driver asked Anne if she was English, he said:
Vous êtes anglaise?
$\ddot{2}$
This is called a liaison. Liaisons are a feature of French pronunciation. There are some rules, but the easiest way is to try to imitate what you hear as much as you can.

Verbs in French change their form according to the person (je, tu, il, elle, etc.) they are used with. This is called conjugation. We have provided you with more information on how verbs are conjugated in the reference grammar.
